  PS2 Overview

This document, inspired by nocash's websites for various consoles, aims to be a comprehensive reference for the PlayStation 2 hardware. While it is far from complete, it is usable as a reference for what information is documented.

PS2 Hardware

Emotion Engine (EE) - Main CPU.
  DMAC - Intelligent DMA controller. Used for accessing most peripherals on the EE.
  EE Timers - Four 16-bit timers.
  Graphics Interface (GIF) - Transmits graphical data to the GS.
  Vector Interface (VIF) - Decompresses vector data, uploads microprograms to the VUs, and sends graphical data to the GIF.
  Vector Units (VUs) - Custom DSPs used to process vertex data, physics calculations, and other related tasks.
  Image Processing Unit (IPU) - MPEG1/MPEG2 video decoder.
  Scratchpad - 16 KB of fast memory.
  
Graphics Synthesizer (GS) - Fixed-function GPU. Designed to draw polygons very, very fast.
  PCRTC - Renders GS output to a television screen. Can be programmed to work on a variety of TVs, including NTSC and PAL.
  
Input/Output Processor (IOP) - Duplicate of the PSX's CPU. Used for slower input/output tasks and for PSX backwards compatibility.
  IOP DMA - Same channels as on the PSX, along with additional channels exclusive to PS2 mode.
  IOP Timers - Same timers as on the PSX, with three additional 32-bit counters.
  CDVD Drive - Reads disc media. Also responsible for MagicGate decryption.
  SIO2 - Serial ports used to read controllers and memory cards.
  SPU2 - Sound processor. Similar to the PSX SPU with added features.
  DEV9 - Expansion port. Used mainly for the PS2 HDD and Network Adapter.
  USB
  FireWire
  
Subsystem Interface (SIF) - Allows the EE and IOP to communicate with each other.

  EE Architecture

On real hardware, the EE itself contains many different hardware units along with the main CPU, such as the DMAC and IPU. This document will consider the EE as only the MIPS CPU and its coprocessors.

  Mix of MIPS III and MIPS IV with dozens of custom instructions
  Speed: 294.912 MHz
  Superscalar, able to issue two instructions per cycle in ideal conditions
  Support for custom integer SIMD instructions known as MMI (MultiMedia Instructions)
  16 KB instruction cache
  8 KB data cache
  16 KB scratchpad. Fast memory directly accessible by program and DMAC
  COP0 system coprocessor. Responsible for handling memory management, exceptions, caches, and performance counters
  COP1 FPU. Fast single-precision unit
  COP2 VU0. SIMD floating-point processor that can either run as a separate CPU or be used by the EE core for COP2 instructions

See Vector Unit (VU) for a general discussion on the VUs, including VU0.


  EE Registers

General-Purpose Registers (GPRs)
As per MIPS tradition, the EE has 32 GPRs. Notably, they are all 128-bit, though the full 128 bits are only used in certain instructions.

  Name       Convention
  zero       Hardwired to 0, writes are ignored
  at         Temporary register used for pseudo-instructions
  v0-v1      Return register, holds values returned by functions
  a0-a3      Argument registers, holds first four parameters passed to a function
  t0-t7      Temporary registers. t0-t3 may also be used as additional argument registers
  s0-s7      Saved registers. Functions must save and restore these before using them
  t8-t9      Temporary registers
  k0-k1      Reserved for use by kernels
  gp         Global pointer
  sp         Stack pointer
  fp         Frame pointer
  ra         Return address. Used by JAL and (usually) JALR to store the address to return to after a function

Aside from zero, all GPRs may be freely accessed if convention rules are respected.

Special Registers

  Name       Purpose
  pc         Program counter, address of currently-executing instruction (32-bit)
  hi/lo      Stores multiplication and division results (64-bit)
  hi1/lo1    Used by MULT1/DIV1 type instructions, same as above (64-bit)
  sa         Shift amount used by QFSRV instruction

  EE RDRAM initialization

During the early boot stages, the BIOS writes to a pair of registers; MCH_DRD and MCH_RICM used to initialize RDRAM. Not much is known about these registers. The following logic used in emulators:
Read

  case 0x1000f430:
  {
    return 0;
  }
  case 0x1000f440:
  {
    uint8_t SOP = (MCH_RICM >> 6) & 0xF;
    uint8_t SA = (MCH_RICM >> 16) & 0xFFF;
    if (!SOP)
    {
        switch (SA)
        {
        case 0x21:
            if (rdram_sdevid < 2)
            {
                rdram_sdevid++;
                return 0x1F;
            }
            return 0;
        case 0x23:
            return 0x0D0D;
        case 0x24:
            return 0x0090;
        case 0x40:
            return MCH_RICM & 0x1F;
        }
    }
    return 0;
  }


Write

  case 0x1000f430:
  {
      uint8_t SA = (data >> 16) & 0xFFF;
      uint8_t SBC = (data >> 6) & 0xF;

      if (SA == 0x21 && SBC == 0x1 && ((MCH_DRD >> 7) & 1) == 0)
          rdram_sdevid = 0;

      MCH_RICM = data & ~0x80000000;

  EE COP0 Exception Handling

Exceptions
An exception is an exceptional event that stops the CPU's current task and forces it to address the event, usually with kernel privileges.
On the EE, there are exceptions for interrupts, TLB management, syscalls, and various errors. When an exception occurs, the EE jumps to one of the following vectors:

    Name            Normal      Bootstrap   Level
  ------------------------------------------------
  | Reset/NMI     | BFC00000h | BFC00000h | 2    |
  ------------------------------------------------
  | TLB Refill    | 80000000h | BFC00200h | 1    |
  ------------------------------------------------
  | Perf. Counter | 80000080h | BFC00280h | 2    |
  ------------------------------------------------
  | Debug         | 80000100h | BFC00300h | 2    |
  ------------------------------------------------
  | All others    | 80000180h | BFC00380h | 1    |
  ------------------------------------------------
  | Interrupt     | 80000200h | BFC00400h | 1    |
  ------------------------------------------------

The full exception handling works as follows.

  void handle_exception_level1(u32 vector, u8 cause)
  {
      Cause.ExcCode = cause;
      if (in_branch_delay)
      {
          EPC = PC - 4;
          Cause.BD = true;
      }
      else
      {
          EPC = PC;
          Cause.BD = false;
      }
      Status.EXL = true;
      PC = vector;
  }
  
  void handle_exception_level2(u32 vector, u8 cause)
  {
      Cause.ExcCode = cause;
      if (in_branch_delay)
      {
          ErrorEPC = PC - 4;
          Cause.BD2 = true;
      }
      else
      {
          ErrorEPC = PC;
          Cause.BD2 = false;
      }
      Status.ERL = true;
      PC = vector;
  }


$08 - COP0.BadVAddr

Cause is used to determine what caused an exception.
The BD/BD2 bits are important as when they are set, EPC/ErrorEPC is set to the address of the branch instruction, not its delay slot. This allows the EE to re-execute the branch when it returns from an exception.

$14/$30 - COP0.EPC/COP0.ErrorEPC

  0-31  Address to return to after an exception

EPC and ErrorEPC are used by level 1 and 2 exceptions respectively. When the ERET instruction is executed, it jumps to the address in EPC or ErrorEPC, depending on if Status.EXL or Status.ERL is set.

$23 - COP0.BadPAddr

  0-31  Physical address that caused an exception

BadPAddr is written to when a bus error occurs and Status.BEM is not set.


  EE COP0 Memory Management

Virtual Memory Basics
Virtual memory is a mechanism that allows processors to arbitrarily map a virtual address to a physical address. This is accomplished using a Memory Management Unit (MMU). For example, a program might access address 1000h. With virtual memory, this address could map to any physical address, such as 1000h, 20000h, 424000h, and so on. Virtual address 1000h might also not be mapped to anything, in which case accessing it causes an error. The PS2 and most modern OSes do not map addresses near NULL, so that if a program uses a NULL pointer, it can crash immediately rather than corrupt program data.

MIPS Memory Segments
The MIPS architecture splits the memory space in half for the user and kernel, and kernelspace is further partitioned into various segments.

     Name          Range                     Description
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  | kuseg | 00000000h-7FFFFFFFh | User, TLB-mapped                  |
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  | kseg0 | 80000000h-9FFFFFFFh | Kernel, directly-mapped, cached   |
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  | kseg1 | A0000000h-BFFFFFFFh | Kernel, directly-mapped, uncached |
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  | ksseg | C0000000h-DFFFFFFFh | Supervisor, TLB-mapped            |
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  | kseg3 | E0000000h-FFFFFFFFh | Kernel, TLB-mapped                |
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

Accessing a privileged region without the necessary privileges raises an Address Error exception.
For kseg0 and kseg1, the physical address retrieved is simply (address & 1FFFFFFFh).

Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
The EE uses a TLB, a cache of virtual->physical mappings, for memory management. The TLB contains 48 entries split into even and odd pages. A TLB entry has the following format:

  1       V0 - Even page valid. When not set, the memory referenced in this entry is not mapped.
  2       D0 - Even page dirty. When not set, writes cause an exception.
  3-5     C0 - Even page cache mode.
          2=Uncached
          3=Cached
          7=Uncached accelerated
  6-25    PFN0 - Even page frame number.
  33      V1 - Odd page valid.
  34      D1 - Odd page dirty.
  35      C1 - Odd page cache mode.
  38-57   PFN1 - Odd page frame number.
  63      S - Scratchpad. When set, the virtual mapping goes to scratchpad instead of main memory.
  64-71   ASID - Address Space ID.
  76      G - Global. When set, ASID is ignored.
  77-95   VPN2 - Virtual page number / 2.
          Even pages have a VPN of (VPN2 * 2) and odd pages have a VPN of (VPN2 * 2) + 1
  109-120 MASK - Size of an even/odd page.

The units of PFN0/PFN1 and VPN2 depend on MASK. For example, if MASK indicates a size of 4 KB, then if PFN0/PFN1 are 10h/11h and VPN2 is 8h, the virtual address of the even page is (8h * 2 * 4096) or 10000h, and the virtual address of the odd page is ((8h * 2) + 1) * 4096 or 11000h.
The physical addresses of the even/odd pages are also 10000h/11000h respectively. Therefore, an access to 10500h will touch physical address 10500h.

$0 - COP0.Index

  0-5   TLB entry to access with TLBR/TLBWI


$1 - COP0.Random

  0-5   TLB entry to access with TLBWR

Random decrements after every instruction that is executed. It has an upper bound of 47 and a lower bound of the value in Wired.

$2/$3 - COP0.EntryLo0/EntryLo1

  0       G - Global.
  1       V - Page valid. When not set, the memory referenced in this entry is not mapped.

          7=Uncached accelerated
  6-25    PFN - Page frame number.
  31      S - Scratchpad. Only applicable for EntryLo0.

EntryLo0/EntryLo1 modify the lower part of the TLB as given for the even page and odd page respectively.
The Global bit in the TLB entry is only set if both EntryLo0 and EntryLo1 have their G bit set.

  EE COP0 Caches

Cache Basics
As technology has progressed, CPU speeds have far outpaced memory speeds. An access to main RAM on the PS2 takes around 40 EE cycles, and on a modern computer, it can be hundreds of cycles! CPU caches alleviate this problem. They are smaller but faster buffers of memory that the CPU attempts to access when fetching instructions or loading/storing data.
If the CPU finds what it is looking for in the cache, it is called a cache hit. If the CPU has to access main memory, it is called a cache miss.

Modern caches are very complex and have multiple levels, but the EE's caches are rather simple, having only a single level and two ways.

EE Cache Structure
The instruction cache and data cache are split into 128 and 64 cache lines respectively. Each line has two 64-byte (4-quadword) ways, which means the icache and dcache are 16 KB and 8 KB respectively.
Each way has a tag which stores metadata about the way, including, for instance, if the way has valid data in it.
The structure of the tags for the icache and dcache is as follows.

    icache
    -------------------------------------------
    |V|R|                 PFN                 |
    -------------------------------------------
  
    dcache
    -------------------------------------------
    |D|V|R|L|             PFN                 |
    -------------------------------------------
  
    V=Valid. If set, the way contains valid data.
    R=LRF bit. Used for the LRF cache replacement algorithm.
    D=Dirty. Set on writes. If set when the way is reloaded, the data is first stored to main memory before loading new data.
    L=Locked. Prevents the way from ever being reloaded. Only allowed for a single way in a line.

Each cache line is indexed by virtual address. Here is how a virtual address is used:

    icache
    31---------------------------------14-13-------------6-5---------0
    |                 PFN                 |     index      | offset  |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    dcache
    31------------------------------------13-12----------6-5---------0
    |                 PFN                    |    index    | offset  |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    Note how the dcache index is 6-bit, whereas the icache index is 7-bit.

The index is used to get the cache line to access. The offset is used to, of course, offset into the 64-byte region.

Cache Misses and Replacement Algorithm
When accessing the cache, the EE checks both ways in a line by comparing the address's PFN with the PFNs in the ways' tags. If both lookups fail, a cache miss has occurred, and new data needs to be loaded into the cache.
The EE uses a Least Recently Filled (LRF) algorithm to determine which way to load data into. If either way does not have the Valid bit set, the EE sets the Valid bit in the first way that does not have it and loads data into it. If both ways are full, the EE takes the XOR of the LRF bits in the tags. The result is the index of the way it uses. The EE then flips the LRF bit in the selected way.
If a way in the data cache has the Locked bit set, the EE will always reload the other way. This allows important data to remain in the cache indefinitely.

Four quadwords are loaded into a way at a time. Since the EE bus is 128-bit, this means a cache miss has a penalty of a minimum of four bus cycles (eight EE cycles). However, main memory is much slower - ~40 EE cycles is closer to reality, though the exact number is nondeterministic due to the nature of RDRAM.

Cache Coherency
Because the caches are separate from main memory, it is possible for the contents of the caches to be different from the contents of main memory.
This is not an issue when simply accessing memory. However, other hardware components such as the DMAC cannot read from the cache. When transferring or receiving data from hardware peripherals, the program is expected to maintain cache coherency by flushing the cache, which forces the cache to synchronize its contents with main memory.

Sony's SDK correctly maintains cache coherency in most cases, so most games are none the wiser. Certain games are so buggy, however, that they require cache emulation to work.
Some examples:

    Dead or Alive 2: Re-uses the same buffer for sending and receiving data in a library that communicates with a custom sound module on the IOP.
    Without cache emulation, the IOP will overwrite data in the send/receive buffer, preventing the game from booting.
    Ice Age 2: The Meltdown: Function returns a pointer to a stack array used to send data to the IOP. Astute C programmers will recognize this as undefined behavior.
    The game immediately flushes the cache after calling this function, so the ensuing corruption only occurs in the cache, and the data in main memory is protected.
    Savage Skies: Similar to IA2. Allocates a VIF DMA buffer on the stack, then starts a transfer without waiting for it to end and returns from a function.
    Without cache emulation, the buffer is corrupted and the game is unable to go in-game.
    WRC 4: Notably requires icache emulation. Main executable is a small decompressor that decompresses a larger executable.
    The decompressed ELF is large enough to overlap with the decompressor in memory. Without icache emulation, the decompressor is destroyed.


  EE COP0 Timer

$09 - COP0.Count

  0-31  Timer count value

Count increments automatically every EE cycle.

$11 - COP0.Compare

  0-31  Timer compare value

When Count==Compare, a COP0 timer interrupt is signaled. Writing to Compare acknowledges and clears the pending interrupt.


  EE COP1 Registers

Floating-point Registers (FPRs)

  Name       Convention
  f0-f3      Return values
  f4-f11     Temporary registers
  f12-f19    Argument registers
  f20-f31    Saved registers


Special Registers (accessed through CFC1/CTC1)

  Name       Purpose
  fcr0       Reports implementation and revision of FPU
  fcr31      Control register, stores status flags



  EE COP1 Floating Point Format

COP1, along with the rest of the PS2, only supports single-precision floats. The PS2 uses IEEE 754 floats with the following format:

  31-30---------23-22---------------------------------------------0
  |si|   exponent  |                mantissa                      |
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

"si" is the sign bit, and the mantissa is the fractional component. The float is calculated as follows.

  num = (si ? -1 : 1) * 2 ^ (exponent - 127) * (1.mantissa)

1.mantissa means the number 1 and all the fractional bits following the decimal.
For example, 3F800000h becomes 1.0f.

IEEE 754 Differences
There are major differences between the PS2 floating-point format and standard IEEE 754, used in most modern computers.

    NaNs and Infinities do not exist on the PS2. In IEEE 754, any number with the exponent field set to 255 is a NaN/Infinity. On the PS2, it is treated as a normal value. This means the upper range of PS2 floats is greater than on IEEE 754.
    Denormals, numbers with the exponent field set to 0, do not exist on the PS2. For every arithmetic operation, a denormal is automatically truncated to zero.
    On the PS2, the rounding mode is always forced to round-towards-zero. The PS2 uses a quirky version where the least-significant-bit may vary after a round, and the details on this are not well understood.


  EE Timers

The EE has four hardware timers. They are all functionally equivalent, though T0 and T1 have an additional register used when an SBUS interrupt occurs.
T3 is reserved by the BIOS for alarm functions. All other timers may be used freely.

10000000h + N*800h TN_COUNT

  0-15  Current counter

16-bit counter incremented according to the settings in TN_MODE. Writes set the counter to the given value.

10000010h + N*800h TN_MODE

  0-1   Clock
        0=Bus clock (~147 MHz)
        1=Bus clock / 16
        2=Bus clock / 256
        3=HBLANK
  2     Gate enable
  3     Gate type
        0=HBLANK
        1=VBLANK
  4-5   Gate mode
        0=Count while gate not active
        1=Reset counter when gate goes from low to high
        2=Reset counter when gate goes from high to low
        3=Reset counter for high<->low gate transitions
  6     Clear counter when it reaches compare value
  7     Timer enable
  8     Compare interrupt enable - trigger interrupt when COUNT==COMP
  9     Overflow interrupt enable - trigger interrupt when COUNT goes from FFFFh to 0000h
  10    Compare interrupt flag
        W: Clears flag
  11    Overflow interrupt flag
        W: Clears flag

Timer interrupts are edge-triggered: an interrupt will only be sent to the EE if either interrupt flag goes from 0 to 1.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban relies on this behavior, as it does not clear the interrupt flags in the timer handler but rather in a different part of the code. Not emulating this will cause the game to crash by reading from NULL.

10000020h + N*800h TN_COMP

  0-15  Compare value


10000030h + N*800h TN_HOLD

  0-15  Counter value when an SBUS interrupt occurs

Only exists for T0 and T1.

Vertical and horizontal timings are presented below.

Vertical Timings

  PAL:  312 scanlines per frame (VBOFF: 286 | VBON: 26)
  NTSC: 262 scanlines per frame (VBOFF: 240 | VBON: 22)


Horizontal Timings

  PAL:  9436 BUSCLK cycles per scanline
  NTSC: 9370 BUSCLK cycles per scanline


  Graphics Interface (GIF)

The GIF sends textures and geometry to the GS. It takes data from three different PATHs:
- PATH1: VU1 via XGKICK instruction. Highest priority.
- PATH2: VIF1 via DIRECT/DIRECTHL. Medium priority.
- PATH3: GIF DMAC channel (channel 2). Lowest priority.
Only one PATH may run at a time. Under normal conditions, when one PATH stops, the highest priority queued PATH will begin transfer.

  GIFtags

The basic unit of GIF transfer data is the GIF packet. Each packet is split into one or more primitives. Every primitive must be preceded by a GIFtag.

GIFtag Format

  0-14    NLOOP - Data per register to transfer
  15      EOP - End of packet
  16-45   Unused
  46      Enable PRIM field
  47-57   Data to be sent to GS PRIM register if GIFtag.46 == 1
  58-59   Data format
          0=PACKED
          1=REGLIST
          2=IMAGE
          3=IMAGE
  60-63   NREGS - Number of registers
          0=16 registers
  64-127  Register field, 4 bits each


When NLOOP == 0, all fields are ignored except EOP and no further processing is done.
When GIFtag.46 == 0, an idle cycle is inserted before processing begins.
Registers are handled in little-endian order; i.e. bits 64-67 are processed first, then 68-71, and so on.

NOTE: The GS Q register is initialized to 1.0f when reading a GIFtag.


  GIF Data Formats

The data format after a GIFtag varies depending on the value of GIFtag.58-59. The GIF can transfer to the GS in PACKED, REGLIST, or IMAGE formats.

PACKED Format
Data is transferred in units of quadwords (16 bytes). Total amount of data in the GIF primitive = NLOOP * NREGS.
All registers not specified below output the lower 64-bits of the quadword to their GS register directly. The upper 64-bits are discarded.

Current reg=0h PRIM

  0-10    Data to write to GS PRIM
  11-127  Unused


Current reg=1h RGBA

  Writes to RGBAQ register (Q is unchanged)
  0-7     R

  64-71   B
  72-95   Unused
  96-103  A
  104-127 Unused

R, G, B, and A are 8-bit values. Q is set by the STQ command.

Current reg=2h STQ

  Writes to ST register and Q component of RGBAQ.
  0-31    S
  32-63   T
  64-95   Q
  96-127  Unused

S, T, and Q are single-precision (32-bit) floats in IEEE 754 format.

Current reg=3h UV

  0-13    U
  14-31   Unused
  32-45   V
  46-127  Unused

U and V are 14-bit unsigned fixed-point integers with a 4-bit fractional component.

Current reg=4h XYZ2F/XYZ3F

  108-110 Unused
  111     Disable drawing (1=write to XYZ3F, 0=write to XYZ2F)
  112-127 Unused

X and Y are signed 16-bit fixed-point integers with a 4-bit fractional component.
Z is a 24-bit integer, and F is an 8-bit integer.
The "disable drawing" bit controls whether the data is written to XYZ2F or XYZ3F.

Current reg=5h XYZ2/XYZ3

  108-127 Unused


Current reg=Eh A+D (output data to specified address)

  0-63    Data
  64-71   Register address
  72-127  Unused

Outputs data to the given register address.

WARNING: Do not use this register descriptor on PATH3 when PATH1 is also running, or the GS may lock up!

Current reg=Fh NOP

  Data not output to GS.


REGLIST Format
Total data in GIF primitive = NREGS * NLOOP, in units of doublewords. (64-bits)
In REGLIST, a doubleword is sent directly to the register descriptor. Every quadword contains data for two registers. When the data is prepared properly, this can multiply data density by up to a factor of 2.
When NREGS * NLOOP is odd, the last doubleword in a primitive is discarded.

IMAGE Format
Total data in GIF primitive = NLOOP only, in units of quadwords.
IMAGE is a shortcut for writing to the GS HWREG register, which transfers textures and other data to VRAM. Each quadword has enough data for two writes to HWREG.

PATH1 and PATH2 transfer to the GS without any internal buffering. However, PATH3 has a 16-quadword GIF FIFO.
When PATH3 masking is enabled, data sent by PATH3 will reside in the FIFO until the mask is lifted. This is useful for queueing texture transfers while other paths are sending geometry. GTA: San Andreas, Lemmings, and some other games rely on this.

Furthermore, Wallace and Gromit at Project Zoo will enable the mask and start a GIF DMA transfer, expecting it to finish. Emulating PATH3 masking without emulating the GIF FIFO will cause it to hang on a black screen, as the DMA channel is unable to write any data.


  DMA Controller (DMAC)

The DMAC gives an interface for the EE to access the rest of the system. It can transfer one quadword (16 bytes) at bus speed (half the rate of the EE's clock).

  0-30  Address (lower 4 bits must be zero)
  31    Memory selection (0=RAM, 1=scratchpad)

The channel will read from/write to MADR directly during a transfer. TADR is only used for chain mode.
MADR and TADR update while a transfer is ongoing, i.e., the DMAC has no internal channels for memory addresses.
Certain games expect MADR and TADR to increment during a transfer.

1000xx20h Dn_QWC - Quadword count (R/W)

  16-25  Channel priority (0=Channel disabled, only if D_PCR.31 is true)
  26-30  Unused
  31     Priority enable

COP0 control determines whether or not CPCOND0 is activated. If (~control | D_STAT.0-9) == 0x3FF, CPCOND0 is set. This is useful for knowing when multiple DMA transfers have finished without using interrupts.

  All other bits appear to be garbage, but writable
  SCPH-39001 (and other BIOSes?) seems to expect D_ENABLER to be set to 1201h upon boot



  DMAC Chain Mode

The DMAC can intelligently chain DMA transfers together. When a transfer starts in chain mode, the channel will transfer QWC quadwords and then read a DMAtag.
In source chain mode, the DMAtag comes from TADR. In destination chain mode, the DMAtag comes from the peripheral the channel is reading from.

DMAtag

  0-15    QWC to transfer
  16-25   Unused
  26-27   Priority control
          0=No effect
          1=Reserved
          2=Priority control disabled (D_PCR.31 = 0)
          3=Priority control enabled (D_PCR.31 = 1)
  28-30   Tag ID
  31      IRQ
  32-62   ADDR field (lower 4 bits must be zero)
  63      Memory selection for ADDR (0=RAM, 1=scratchpad)
  64-127  Data to transfer (only if Dn_CHCR.TTE==1)

When both IRQ and Dn_CHCR.TIE are set, the transfer ends after QWC has been transferred.
When Dn_CHCR.TTE is on, bits 64-127 are transferred BEFORE QWC.
The effects of the tag ID vary depending on if the channel is in source chain or dest chain mode.

Source Chain Tag ID

  0    refe    MADR=DMAtag.ADDR
               TADR+=16
               tag_end=true
  
  1    cnt     MADR=TADR+16 (next to DMAtag)
               TADR=MADR (next to transfer data)
  
  2    next    MADR=TADR+16
               TADR=DMAtag.ADDR
  
  3    ref     MADR=DMAtag.ADDR
               TADR+=16
  
  4    refs    MADR=DMAtag.ADDR
               TADR+=16
  
  5    call    MADR=TADR+16
               if (CHCR.ASP == 0)
                 ASR0=MADR+(QWC*16)
               else if (CHCR.ASP == 1)
                 ASR1=MADR+(QWC*16)
               TADR=DMAtag.ADDR
               CHCR.ASP++
  
  6    ret     MADR=TADR+16
               if (CHCR.ASP == 2)
                 TADR=ASR1
                 CHCR.ASP--
               else if (CHCR.ASP == 1)
                 TADR=ASR0
                 CHCR.ASP--
               else
                 tag_end=true
  
  7    end     MADR=TADR+16
                 tag_end=true
               

When tag_end=true, the transfer ends after QWC has been transferred.

Dest Chain Tag ID

  0    cnt     MADR=DMAtag.ADDR
  
  1    cnts    MADR=DMAtag.ADDR
  
  7    end     MADR=DMAtag.ADDR
               tag_end=true


DMA Resuming
If a transfer starts in source chain mode and QWC > 0, the DMAC assumes that the TAG field of CHCR was the last read DMAtag. This means that if the tag ID is REFE or END, the channel will stop after QWC has been transferred.
Sony's movie-playing library requires this behavior, as it uses MADR to determine the current movie buffer position.


  DMAC MFIFO

Scratchpad memory is much faster than main memory, but the scratchpad is a measly 16 KB, only enough for 1024 quadwords of data.
The Memory FIFO (MFIFO) works around this issue by automatically transferring data sent via SPR_FROM to a user-defined buffer in main memory. The D_RBSR and D_RBOR registers define the size and location of this buffer. SPR_FROM's MADR is automatically set to the next read position in the buffer, wrapping around when the end is reached.

Either the VIF1 DMA channel or GIF DMA channel can be the drain channel, reading from the buffer when SPR_FROM transfers data to it. When a new tag is read, the drain channel's TADR is set to D_RBOR | (TADR & D_RBSR), as is MADR if QWC is non-zero and the tag ID is not REF/REFE/REFS.
When TADR equals SPR_FROM's MADR, the drain channel is stalled, and an MFIFO empty interrupt is triggered. If the tag ID is REF/REFE/REFS and QWC is non-zero, an interrupt is still sent but the channel is not stalled.

At first, it may seem odd to use MFIFO, because the extra transfer is slower than just interacting with VIF1/GIF DMA directly. However, VIF1 and the GIF have a tendency to stall for long periods of time when transferring data to the GS because of VU1 transferring data to PATH1. MFIFO allows the EE to queue up data without worrying about GIF stalls and managing DMA buffers, which in turn allows the EE to do other things more efficiently.


  DMAC Interrupts

Upon any transfer completion, the DMAC will raise the channel's stat flag in D_STAT. When (stat & mask) != 0, the DMAC asserts an INT1 signal to the EE.
INT1 may also be asserted when MFIFO is empty, a stall occurs, or a bus error occurs. The bus error is not maskable via D_STAT.
NOTE: INT0 (INTC) has priority over INT1. If INT0 and INT1 are asserted at the same time, the INT0 interrupt will be processed first.

  GS Primitives

The GS supports point, line, triangle, and sprite (2D rectangle with two points) primitives.

00h PRIM

  0-2   Primitive type
        0=Point
        1=Line
        2=LineStrip
        3=Triangle
        4=TriangleStrip
        5=TriangleFan
        6=Sprite
        7=Reserved
  3     Gourand shading
  4     Texture mapping
  5     Fog
  6     Alpha blending
  7     Antialiasing
  8     Use UV for texture coordinates (0=Use STQ)
  9     Use Context 2's registers for drawing (0=Use Context 1)
  10    Fix fragment value (related to antialiasing?)


1Ah PRMODECONT
When this register is set to 1, bits 3-10 in PRIM are used when rendering primitives. Otherwise, bits 3-10 in PRMODE are used.

1Bh PRMODE
Same as PRIM, except bits 0-2 are unused.
PRMODE can be useful when you want to draw multiple primitives with different attributes but the same type.


  GS Vertex Attributes

01h RGBAQ

  0-7    Red
  8-15   Green
  16-23  Blue
  24-31  Alpha
  32-63  Q

These attributes are applied to newly created vertices.

04h/0Ch XYZF2/XYZF3

  0-15   X
  16-31  Y
  32-55  Z
  56-63  Fog coefficient (placed in FOG register)

This defines a new vertex to be placed in the vertex queue, a process known as the vertex kick. X and Y are 12-bit fixed-point integers with a 4-bit fractional component, ranging from 0 to 4095.9375.
When 1, 2, or 3 vertices have been defined as per the primitive type, a "drawing kick" occurs, where the GS begins drawing the primitive.
NOTE: Drawing kicks can only occur on XYZF2! XYZF3 will clear the queue as needed but will not draw any primitives. XYZF3 exists to allow the programmer to easily cull polygons, as the GS has no native support for culling.

See GS Fog for details on fog.

05h/0Dh XYZ2/XYZ3

  0-15   X
  16-31  Y
  32-63  Z

Same as XYZF2/XYZF3, except Z is a 32-bit unsigned integer rather than a 24-bit unsigned integer.
XYZ2 can also result in a drawing kick, whereas XYZ3 cannot.

18h/19h XYOFFSET_1/2

  0-15   X
  32-47  Y

When a vertex kick occurs, XYOFFSET is subtracted from the vertex's X and Y coordinates.


  GS Frame and Z Buffers

4Ch/4Dh FRAME_1/2

  0-8    Base pointer in words/2048
  16-21  Buffer width in pixels/64
  24-29  Format
         00h=PSMCT32
         01h=PSMCT24
         02h=PSMCT16
         0Ah=PSMCT16S
         30h=PSMZ32
         31h=PSMZ24
         32h=PSMZ16
         3Ah=PSMZ16S
  32-63  Framebuffer mask

Bits 32-63 prevent the specified bits in the framebuffer from being updated by the following formula:
final_color = (final_color & ~mask) | (frame_color & mask)
This mask is applied before format conversions, e.g., bit 63 of FRAME will affect bit 15 (alpha bit) of a 16-bit color.

4Eh/4Fh ZBUF_1/2

  0-8    Base pointer in words/2048
  24-27  Format
         00h=PSMZ32
         01h=PSMZ24
         02h=PSMZ16
         0Ah=PSMZ16S
  32     Buffer mask (1=do not update zbuffer)

The zbuffer's width is the same as the framebuffer's, specified in FRAME.


  GS Transfers

The GS supports GIF->VRAM, VRAM->VRAM, and VRAM->GIF data transfers.

50h BITBLTBUF

  0-13    Source base pointer in words/64
  16-21   Source buffer width in pixels/64
  24-29   Source format
          00h=PSMCT32
          01h=PSMCT24
          02h=PSMCT16
          0Ah=PSMCT16S
          13h=PSMCT8
          14h=PSMCT4
          1Bh=PSMCT8H
          24h=PSMCT4HL
          2Ch=PSMCT4HH
          30h=PSMZ32
          31h=PSMZ24
          32h=PSMZ16
          3Ah=PSMZ16S
  32-45   Destination base pointer in words/64
  48-53   Destination buffer width in pixels/64
  56-61   Destination format (same as source format)

In VRAM->VRAM transfers, the source and destination formats must have the same bits per pixel.

51h TRXPOS

  0-10    X for source rectangle
  16-26   Y for source rectangle
  32-42   X for destination rectangle
  48-58   Y for destination rectangle
  59-60   Transmission order for VRAM->VRAM transfers
          0=Upper-left->lower-right
          1=Lower-left->upper-right
          2=Upper-right->lower-left
          3=Lower-right->upper-left

X and Y are in units of pixels and define the upper-left corner of their respective rectangle.
NOTE: During transfer, X and Y wrap around if they exceed 2048, e.g., by the following formula:
X = (TRXPOS.X + TRXREG.width) % 2048

52h TRXREG

  0-11    Width in pixels of transmission area
  32-43   Height in pixels of transmission area


53h TRXDIR

  0-1     Transmission direction
          0=GIF->VRAM
          1=VRAM->GIF
          2=VRAM->VRAM
          3=Deactivated

Note that the privileged register BUSDIR must be set appropriately for GIF->VRAM and VRAM->GIF.

54h HWREG

  0-63    Data to be transferred for GIF->VRAM

The "IMAGE" GIFtag format is a shortcut for writing to this register. Data is packed according to the format. For example, PSMCT4 will have 16 4-bit pixels per doubleword.

  51-54   CLUT format
  55      CLUT uses CSM2 (0=CSM1)
  56-60   CLUT entry offset/16
  61-63   CLUT cache control (same as TEX0)

TEX2 is a subset of TEX0. This is useful for modifying texture format and CLUT information when the texture base pointer, width, etc. must stay the same.

3Fh TEXFLUSH
Writing any value to this register will invalidate the texture cache. Do this in the following situations:
- Using newly transferred texture data
- Using newly transferred CLUT data or reloading the CLUT cache
- Using framebuffer or zbuffer data as textures

Texture coordinates
The GS supports STQ texture coordinates and UV texel coordinates. The relationship between the two is as follows.
U=(S/Q)*TEX0.texwidth
V=(T/Q)*TEX0.texheight

Q is defined by RGBAQ and used for perspective correction. It is not possible to use perspective correction when directly using UV coordinates.

02h ST

  0-31    S (lower 8 bits are rounded down to zero)
  32-63   T (lower 8 bits are rounded down to zero)

S and T are (mostly) IEEE 754-compliant single-precision floating-point values. For both S and T, the range [0.0, 1.0] refers to the whole texture.

03h UV

  0-13    U
  16-29   V

U and V are unsigned 10-bit fixed-point integers with a 4-bit fractional component. The ranges [0, TEXWIDTH] and [0, TEXHEIGHT] for U and V respectively refer to the whole texture.

Color function TEX0 defines four possible color functions that can be used to blend texture and vertex colors:

               RGB                            RGBA
  Modulate     Rv = (Rv * Rt) >> 7            <- Same
               Gv = (Gv * Gt) >> 7            <- Same
               Bv = (Bv * Bt) >> 7            <- Same
               Av = Av                        Av = (Av * At) >> 7
  Decal        Rv = Rt                        <- Same
               Gv = Gt                        <- Same
               Bv = Bt                        <- Same
               Av = Av                        Av = At
  Highlight    Rv = ((Rv * Rt) >> 7) + Av     <- Same
               Gv = ((Gv * Gt) >> 7) + Av     <- Same
               Bv = ((Bv * Bt) >> 7) + Av     <- Same
               Av = Av                        Av = At + Av
  Highlight2   Same as Highlight              Same as Highlight, but Av = At



  GS Fog

3Dh FOGCOL

  0-7   R
  8-15  G
  16-23 B

FOGCOL represents the color of a "distant" object, or one enshrounded in fog. See below for details.

0Ah FOG

  0-7  Fog effect

FOG gives a fog effect F to the current vertex. XYZ2F/XYZ3F also modify this register.
During rasterization, if fog is enabled in PRIM/PRMODE, F is linearly interpolated for all vertices. The fog equation is then applied to an outputted texture color after the color function has been applied:
Output = ((F * input) >> 8) + (((255 - F) * FOGCOL) >> 8)
So a value of 0xFF results in no change and a value of 0 completely converts the color to FOGCOL.
You can see that fog equation is just another alpha blending equation.


  GS Alpha Blending

42h/43h ALPHA_1/2

  0-1   Spec A
  2-3   Spec B
  4-5   Spec C
  6-7   Spec D
  8-15  Alpha FIX

The GS's alpha blending formula is fixed but it contains four variables that can be reconfigured:
Output = (((A - B) * C) >> 7) + D
A, B, and D are colors and C is an alpha value. Their specific values come from the ALPHA register:

      A                B                C                   D
  0   Source RGB       Source RGB       Source alpha        Source RGB
  1   Framebuffer RGB  Framebuffer RGB  Framebuffer alpha   Framebuffer RGB
  2   0                0                FIX                 0
  3   Reserved         Reserved         Reserved            Reserved

Internally, alpha-blending treats each color component as 9-bit. The output is then clamped accordingly by COLCLAMP.

46h COLCLAMP

  0    8-bit signed clamp (0=8-bit AND)

When COLCLAMP is 1, RGB components will be 0 if negative after alpha-blending or 0xFF if 0x100 or above. Otherwise, each color component will be ANDed with 0xFF.


  GS Tests and Pixel Control

40h/41h SCISSOR_1/2

  0-10   X0
  16-26  X1
  32-42  Y0
  48-58  Y1

SCISSOR defines a rectangle with 11-bit unsigned integer coordinates, which range from 0 to 2047. During drawing, pixels that fall outside the boundaries of this rectangle fail automatically and are not processed.

47h/48h TEST_1/2

  0      Alpha test enabled
  1-3    Alpha test method
         0=NEVER (all pixels fail)
         1=ALWAYS (all pixels pass)
         2=LESS (pixel alpha < AREF passes)
         3=LEQUAL (pixel alpha <= AREF passes)
         4=EQUAL (pixel alpha == AREF passes)
         5=GEQUAL (pixel alpha >= AREF passes)
         6=GREATER (pixel alpha > AREF passes)
         7=NEQUAL (pixel alpha != AREF passes)
  4-11   AREF
  12-13  Alpha test failure processing
         0=Neither framebuffer nor zbuffer are updated.
         1=Only framebuffer is updated.
         2=Only zbuffer is updated.
         3=Only RGB in framebuffer is updated.
  14     Destination alpha test enabled
  15     Destination alpha test method
         0=destination alpha bit == 0 passes
         1=destination alpha bit == 1 passes
  16     Depth test enabled (0 is prohibited?)
  17-18  Depth test method
         0=NEVER (all pixels fail)
         1=ALWAYS (all pixels pass)
         2=GEQUAL (pixel Z >= zbuffer Z passes)
         3=GREATER (pixel Z > zbuffer Z passes)

Note on destination alpha test:
The alpha bit tested depends on the framebuffer format. If the format is PSMCT32, bit 7 of alpha is tested. If the format is PSMCT16, the sole alpha bit is tested. If the format is PSMCT24, all pixels pass due to the lack of alpha.


  GS Special Effects and Optimizations

The GS has an absurdly high fillrate of 1.2 gigapixels/second when drawing textured polygons. This advantage is further compounded by free (!) alpha blending and depth buffering. However, the GS only supports single-pass texturing and is entirely fixed-unit. The combination of these factors led developers to find creative ways to make their games look good...
Note: many of these effects don't have an official name, so they are made up.

Fast Screen Draw
Drawing a single sprite that covers the entire screen is relatively slow. First, this causes many DRAM page breaks per scanline drawn. Second, for textured sprites, the texture cache also has to be reloaded many times.
Instead, one can split a screen draw into many 64x32 sprites. This greatly improves cache locality, based upon the GS's nonlinear mmemory.
The fast screen draw is often used as a building block for other advanced techniques.

Double Half Clear
Because the framebuffer and depth buffer both occupy the same memory space, framebuffer clears can be optimized by placing the start of the depth buffer halfway down the screen and halving the height of the clear draw. As depth buffering is free, this will result in the clear being around twice as fast.

Interleaved Clear
Similar to the double half clear in principle, but takes advantage of color and depth formats being swizzled differently. The depth buffer base is set to the framebuffer base (ZBP=FBP), and instead of the clear being split into 64x32 sprites, it is split into 32x32 sprites instead. This results in the clear being interleaved, as the color clear touches the left side of a 64x32 block and the depth clear touches the right side. Because the framebuffer and depth buffer share the same cache, this should be faster than a double half clear.

Powerdrome uses a crazy variant of this, where the framebuffer is given a Z format. Due to quirks in the GS rendering process, this causes the depth clear to draw as if it had a color format. This doesn't really speed anything up, as all that changes is the order of the interleave, but it does make emudevs cry a lot.

VIS Clear
Absolutely insane clear used in the VIS Games engine. The framebuffer width (FBW) is set to 1 (64 pixels for a 32-bit texture), then a very thin and tall sprite is drawn. In normal cases, the sprite is 64x2048. The clear is essentially if one took all the pages from the framebuffer, stacked them vertically, then drew a sprite large enough to clear the stack. This should avoid the horizontal page breaks that other methods cause, but it is unknown how fast this clear is.

Superman Returns, another VIS game, uses a somehow wilder variant, where the clear sprite is 32x4096. The sprite is so large, it wraps around from the bottom of VRAM to the top.

Recursive Drawing
Draws where the texture buffer and framebuffer overlap, usually done with TBP = FBP. Because of the texture cache, texels do not get overwritten in VRAM until after they are read. Recursive drawing can be used to apply special effects without having to create a temporary buffer in memory.

Channel Shuffle
A sophisticated technique made to overcome the GS's lack of shader units. At a high level, the most basic channel shuffle effect uses a texture's 32-bit RGBA channels as 8-bit palette indices to apply an effect on the texture, such as gamma correction or a brightness effect.

To perform the channel shuffle, draw a series of 8x2 sprites that read the 32-bit texture as 8-bit - normally this is done with recursive drawing, but temporary buffers can also be used. The size of the sprites is important, as 32-bit and 8-bit textures are swizzled differently. The sprites will read from a palette which applies the effect, then FBMASK is used to restrict the draw to a single channel. This must be repeated for every channel the effect is to be applied to, with a total of four shuffles for all four channels.

This effect is extremely difficult to emulate with a modern GPU. A 640x224 framebuffer requires 8960 8x2 sprites for a single shuffle. The 32-bit texture must be deswizzled, converted to 8-bit, and reconverted back to 32-bit for each sprite. Since this is usually done with recursive drawing, texture memory and framebuffer memory on the host GPU also needs to be synchronized. Finally, modern GPUs mask on the byte level, but games can mask on the bit level, which requires a slow fragment shader to process the effect correctly if the game doesn't fully mask on the byte level. All this results in a channel shuffle being more expensive than even every other draw call in the game. Other variants of channel shuffle also exist that involve reading the depth buffer, and some shuffle effects are not well-understood.


  Vector Interface (VIF)

VIF0 and VIF1 are DMA interfaces for the Vector Units. Their main purpose is to upload microprograms and decompress vectors into VU micro memory and data memory respectively.
VIF1 can also transfer data to the GIF through PATH2 and mask PATH3.

-------------------------------------------------
|    CMD    |    NUM    |       IMMEDIATE       |
-------------------------------------------------


Bit 31 is an interrupt bit - when set, a VIF interrupt is generated after the command executes, and the VIF stalls on the following command except for the MARK command.
NUM and IMMEDIATE are command-specific and are not always used.

Command List
00h NOP
Does nothing. Mainly used for timing PATH3 masking and aligning the DMA stream for certain commands.

01h STCYCL
Sets the CYCLE register to IMMEDIATE. In particular, CYCLE.CL is set to bits 0-7 and CYCLE.WL is set to bits 8-15.
The CYCLE register is used for skipping/filling writes for UNPACK.

02h OFFSET (VIF1)
Sets the OFST register to bits 0-9 of IMMEDIATE. This is used for VIF1 double buffering.
DBF (the double buffering flag) is also cleared to 0 in STAT, and BASE is set to TOPS.

03h BASE (VIF1)
Sets the BASE register to bits 0-9 of IMMEDIATE. This is used for VIF1 double buffering.

04h ITOP
Sets the ITOP register to bits 0-9 of IMMEDIATE. ITOP can be read by the XITOP instruction on the VU.

05h STMOD
Sets the MODE register to bits 0-1 of IMMEDIATE. This is used for addition decompression in UNPACK.

06h MSKPATH3 (VIF1)
Sets the VIF-side PATH3 mask to bit 15 of IMMEDIATE. When PATH3 masking is enabled, the mask is applied to the next data block for PATH3.

07h MARK
Sets the MARK register to IMMEDIATE.

10h FLUSHE
Stalls the VIF until the VU is finished executing a microprogram.

11h FLUSH (VIF1)
Stalls VIF1 until the VU is finished executing a microprogram and PATH1 and PATH2 are not active.

13h FLUSHA (VIF1)
Stalls VIF1 until the VU is finished executing a microprogram, PATH1 and PATH2 are not active, and there is no pending transfer request for PATH3.

14h MSCAL
Starts a microprogram on the VU at the given address IMMEDIATE*8. If the VU is currently active, MSCAL stalls until the VU is finished before executing a new microprogram.

15h MSCALF (VIF1)
Same as MSCAL, but also waits for PATH1 and PATH2 to not be active before starting a microprogram.

17h MSCNT
Starts microprogram execution starting at the VU's TPC register - this usually means the instruction right after the end of the previous microprogram.
If the VU is currently active, MSCNT stalls like MSCAL.

20h STMASK
Sets the MASK register to the next 32-bit word in the stream. This is used for UNPACK write masking.

30h STROW
Sets the R0-R3 row registers to the next 4 32-bit words in the stream. This is used for UNPACK write filling.

31h STCOL
Sets the C0-C3 column registers to the next 4 32-bit words in the stream. This is used for UNPACK write filling.

4Ah MPG
Loads NUM*8 bytes into VU micro memory, starting at the given address IMMEDIATE*8. If the VU is currently active, MPG stalls until the VU is finished before uploading data.
If NUM is 0, then 2048 bytes are loaded.

50h DIRECT (VIF1)
Transfers IMMEDIATE quadwords to the GIF through PATH2. If PATH2 cannot take control of the GIF, the VIF stalls until PATH2 is activated.
If IMMEDIATE is 0, 65,536 quadwords are transferred.

51h DIRECTHL (VIF1)
Same as DIRECT, except DIRECTHL is not able to interrupt PATH3 in IMAGE mode and stalls if PATH3 is transferring in IMAGE mode.

60h-7Fh UNPACK
Decompresses data in various formats to the given address in bits 0-9 of IMMEDIATE multiplied by 16.
If bit 14 of IMMEDIATE is set, the decompressed data is zero-extended. Otherwise, it is sign-extended.
If bit 15 of IMMEDIATE is set, TOPS is added to the starting address. This is only applicable for VIF1.
Bits 0-3 of CMD determine the type of UNPACK that occurs. See VIF UNPACK for details.
Bit 4 of CMD performs UNPACK write masking if set.

  VU Registers

General-purpose registers
Each VU contains 32 vector floating-point registers (vf00-vf31) and 16 16-bit integer registers (vi00-vi15).
A vector register has 4 32-bit single-precision floating-point elements: {x, y, z, w}
vi00 is hardwired to 0. vf00 is hardwired to the vector {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0}. That is to say, vf00.w = 1.0.

Accumulator (ACC)
The accumulator is a special register with the same format as the 32 general-purpose vector registers.
It is intended to be used as an intermediate result by certain instructions.

Q and P
Q and P are 32-bit floating point registers. Operations that use the FDIV or EFU units store their result in the Q and P registers respectively.
For example, a DIV stores its result in Q, and ESQRT stores its result in P.

MAC Flags
Each FMAC unit (corresponding to a vector field) has four MAC flags, which can be read by various instructions.
The MAC flags are overflow, underflow, sign, and zero. The full 16-bit MAC flag register has this format:

15                                              0
-------------------------------------------------
|Ox|Oy|Oz|Ow|Ux|Uy|Uz|Uw|Sx|Sy|Sz|Sw|Zx|Zy|Zz|Zw|
-------------------------------------------------


Zero is set when the result is 0.0f or -0.0f (which also clears overflow and underflow), and sign is set when the result is negative (bit 31 is set).
Overflow and underflow are set when the exponent field is 0xFF or 0x0 respectively.
IMPORTANT: MAC flags are modified in the "writeback" stage in the FMAC pipeline. However, an instruction like FMAND will read the flags in the register read stage, and this does not constitute a hazard.
This means every modification to the MAC flags has a delay of four cycles (not necessarily four instructions).

Clip Flags
The clipping flags register is 24-bit and contains the result of up to four CLIP instructions. Every CLIP instruction produces six flags: -x, +x, -y, +y, -z, +z. They are stored in the following format:

5                 0
-------------------
|-z|+z|-y|+y|-x|+x|
-------------------


Like the MAC flags, the clip flags are also pipelined (and thus delayed).

Status Flags

11                                  0
-------------------------------------
|DS|IS|OS|US|SS|ZS|D |I |O |U |S |Z |
-------------------------------------


The Z, S, U, and O flags are set when any of the field flags for zero, sign, underflow, and overflow are set in the MAC register, respectively.
The I flag is an invalid flag, set to 1 when 0/0 is executed by DIV or when a negative number is used for SQRT/RSQRT.
The D flag is set for division by zero (except for 0/0) on DIV/RSQRT and is always cleared on SQRT.
Bits 6-11 are sticky flags - they do not represent the current state but rather the ORed result of all previous states.
If Z goes from 1 to 0 for instance, ZS will always remain 1 until the status register is written to.


  VU Instruction Format and Decoding

Each VU executes two instructions per cycle - one instruction is in the upper pipeline and the other is in the lower pipeline. A full VU instruction can be considered as a 64-bit doubleword, where the lower 32-bit word is the lower instruction and the upper word is the upper instruction.
Each pipeline is specialized and can only execute certain instructions. The upper pipeline mostly executes floating-point arithmetic instructions, and the lower pipeline mostly executes integer calculations, branches, and some specialized floating-point operations.
The upper instructions can also control various parts of execution, such as ending microprograms, loading values into the I register, and in the case of VU0, synchronization with the EE.

Upper Instructions

3 3 2 2 2 2 2
1-0-9-8-7-6-5-----------------------------------0
|I|E|M|D|T|              instr                  |
-------------------------------------------------


Meaning of the various bits:
-I-bit: I register load. Instead of executing a lower instruction, the VU loads the 32-bit value in the lower pipeline into the I register.
-E-bit: Ends microprogram execution. The E-bit has a delay slot, much like branches.
-M-bit: Only applicable for VU0. Ends interlock on a single QMTC2.I/CTC2.I instruction, allowing the EE to continue execution.
-D-bit: Debug break. Halts the VU and sends an interrupt to the EE.
-T-bit: Debug halt. Acts similarly to D-bit.


  VU Pipelining

Underneath the surface, the VU is full of quirks. This is partially because its pipeline is exposed to the program.

FMAC Pipeline

-------------
|M|T|X|Y|Z|S|
  |M|T|X|Y|Z|
    |M|T|X|Y|
      |M|T|X|
-------------


The FMAC pipeline is split into six stages:

    M: Read instruction from memory
    T: Read VU registers
    X/Y/Z: Execute stages.
    Calculation/flag writeback.

In ideal conditions, one FMAC instruction can be executed every cycle. However, read-after-write hazards - reading a register before its write has completed - induces an FMAC stall for up to three cycles, allowing the previous write to complete.
The FMAC pipeline is used for all instructions except DIV, SQRT, RSQRT, integer calculation, and branching. Integer load/stores also use this pipeline and are subject to hazard checks.
Hazard checks are NOT performed for ACC, VF00, I, Q, P, and R. Hazard checks are performed on each VF field, so writing to VF01y and reading from VF01x does not induce a stall.

Integer Pipeline

-------------
|M|T|X|Y|Z|S|
  |M|T|X|Y|Z|
    |M|T|X|Y|
      |M|T|X|
-------------


The integer pipeline is almost the same as the FMAC pipeline, except that all integer instructions have a latency of 1 cycle due to pipeline bypassing.
The other execute and writeback stages are dummy stages to align with the FMAC pipeline.

FDIV Pipeline

DIV/SQRT
-------------------------
|M|T|D1|D2|D3|D4|D5|D6|F|
-------------------------

RSQRT
-------------------------
|M|T|D1| ........ |D12|F|
-------------------------


The FDIV pipeline is used by DIV, SQRT, and RSQRT. It is similar to the FMAC pipeline, though it has more execution stages.
It can execute concurrently with the other pipelines. However, only one FDIV instruction can execute at a time, and trying to execute another FDIV instruction before the first has completed will induce a stall that affects the whole VU. The WAITQ instruction also induces a stall and can be used for synchronization.
Since no hazard checks are performed when reading Q, when Q is read in the middle of an FDIV instruction, the old value of Q is retrieved.
DIV and SQRT have a latency of 7 cycles, and RSQRT has a latency of 13 cycles. The maximum stall time for DIV/SQRT and RSQRT is 6 and 12 cycles, respectively.

EFU Pipeline

-------------------------
|M|T|N1|N2| ...... |Nn|P|
-------------------------


The EFU pipeline is used by elementary function instructions exclusive to VU1. It is almost the same as the FDIV pipeline, with the only difference being that hazard checks do not occur for the writeback stage, meaning that a stall lasts for one cycle less than usual.
The list of latencies for the EFU instructions is as follows.

EATAN/EATANxy/EATANxz         54
EEXP                          44
ELENG                         18
ERCPR                         12
ERLENG                        24
ERSADD                        18
ERSQRT                        18
ESADD                         11
ESIN                          29
ESQRT                         12
ESUM                          12


The WAITP instruction, like WAITQ, induces a stall on the EFU pipeline.

XGKICK Pipeline
XGKICK uses the FMAC pipeline, but the PATH1 transfer it starts occurs concurrently with VU operation. However, if a second XGKICK is executed in the middle of the first, the instruction after the second XGKICK will stall until the PATH1 transfer is complete.


  Image Processing Unit (IPU)

The IPU is a hardware-accelerated MPEG1/MPEG2 decoder. It is primarily responsible for video playback, though it can also be used to decompress texture data in some cases.

IPU Reference
IPU I/O Registers
IPU Commands


  IPU I/O Registers

10002000h IPU_CMD - IPU Send Command

  0-27  Option - dependent on command
  28-31 Code - the actual command
  
  Read
  0-31  Result of FDEC/VDEC command
  63    Busy

IPU_CMD is where all commands are sent.
Strange quirk: if data is in the IPU through DMA but no commands have been sent, IPU_CMD will contain the first 32 bits of the bitstream. Certain games, e.g., Theme Park Rollercoaster, rely on this behavior to decode the bitstream before sending the first FDEC command.

10002010h IPU_CTRL - IPU Control/Status

  30    RST - Writing 1 to this resets the whole IPU
  31    Busy

When a command is sent, ECD and SCD are cleared to 0. A reset triggers an IPU interrupt if a command is currently executing.

10002020h IPU_BP - Bitstream Position

  0-6   BP - Position within the 128-bit quadword being decoded in bits
  8-11  IFC - Size of data in input FIFO in quadwords
  16-17 FP - Size of data in internal buffer in quadwords

This register is used to determine the amount of unprocessed DMA data currently in the IPU. Sony's FMV library uses this to know what to set MADR to when IPU processing is halted and resumed.

10002030h IPU_BP - Bitstream Position

  0-31  Next 32 bits in the bitstream
  63    Busy/not enough data

The "busy" bit is set when less than 32 bits are in the FIFO. FMV libraries rely on this undocumented behavior.

  CDVD Drive

Using the CDVD drive, the PS2 has the ability to read CDROMs, single-layer DVDs, and dual-layer DVDs. It also sports backwards compatibility with the PSX's CDROM drive in PSX mode.

CDVD commands are either asynchronous (N commands) or synchronous (S commands). Seeks and reads fall into the former category, and miscellaneous commands, such as RTC access, fall into the latter.

CDVD N Commands
CDVD Reads and Seeks
CDVD S Commands


  CDVD I/O Ports

1F402004h Current N command (R/W)
Write to this register to send an N command. For a list of N commands, see
CDVD N Commands

1F402005h N command status (R)

  0     Error (1=error occurred)
  1     Unknown/unused
  2     DEV9 device connected (1=HDD/network adapter connected)
  3     Unknown/unused
  4     Test mode
  5     Power off ready
  6     Drive status (1=ready)
  7     Busy executing NCMD

CDVDMAN reads bits 6 and 7 to know when the device is ready to receive a command - bit 6 must be on and bit 7 must be off.

1F402005h N command param (W)
Send parameters for an N command here. This must be done BEFORE the N command has been sent via 1F402004h.

1F402006h CDVD error (R)
Any non-zero value indicates an error? Unknown what kind of errors are possible and what their values are.

1F402007h BREAK
Writing any value to this register sends a BREAK command to the CDVD drive, stopping execution of the current N command.

1F402008h CDVD I_STAT (R=Status, W=Acknowledge)
Status = Read I_STAT (1=Reason for IRQ)
Acknowledge = Write I_STAT (1=Clear bit)

  0     Data ready?
  1     (N?) Command complete
  2     Power off pressed
  3     Disk ejected
  4     BS_Power DET?
  5-7   Unused

When a CDVD IRQ is raised on I_STAT, this register shows the reason for the interrupt. Bit 0 seems to be raised when a read command completes, but I'm not certain about this...
Unknown if bit 1 only applies to N commands, although this appears to be the case.

1F40200Ah CDVD drive status (R)

  0     Tray status (1=open)
  1     Spindle spinning (1=spinning)
  2     Read status (1=reading data sectors)
  3     Paused
  4     Seek status (1=seeking)
  5     Error (1=error occurred)
  6-7   Unknown


1F40200Bh Sticky drive status (R)
Exact same as 0xA, except the bits are "sticky" - the bits here are ORed with all previous drive states.
CDVDMAN compares 0xA and 0xB to know if the tray status has changed. SCMD 0x5 sets this register to reg 0xA's value.

  0-5   Unknown
  6     Result data available (0=available, 1=no data)
  7     Busy


1F402017h S command params (W)
Parameters must be sent BEFORE the S command is sent.


1F402018h S command result (R)
When an S command has finished executing, read the result here. Some S commands may require multiple reads.

  CDVD N Commands

Parameters are in units of bytes and are little-endian. All N commands raise IRQ2 (bit 1 of CDVD I_STAT).

00h NOP
01h NOPsync
Params: None.
These commands do nothing? They do raise an IRQ upon their "completion".

02h Standby
Params: None.
Returns the read position to sector 0 and sets the drive status to PAUSED.
Possibly also spins the drive if it's not spinning already?

03h Stop
Params: None.
Returns the read position to sector 0 and stops the drive.
Seems to have a 166 ms delay?

04h Pause
Params: None.
Unknown what effect this has, from the perspective of emulation.

05h Seek
Params:

  0-3   Sector position

Moves the read position to the indicated parameter.

06h ReadCd
Params:

  0-3   Sector position
  4-7   Sectors to read
  10    Block size (1=2328 bytes, 2=2340 bytes, all others=2048 bytes)

Performs a CD-style read. Seems to raise bit 0 of CDVD I_STAT upon completion?

08h ReadDvd
Params:

  0-3   Sector position
  4-7   Sectors to read

Performs a DVD-style read, with a block size of 2064 bytes. The format of the data is as follows:

  0    1    Volume number + 0x20
  1    3    Sector number - volume start + 0x30000, in big-endian.
  4    8    ? (all zeroes)
  12   2048 Raw sector data
  2060 4    ? (all zeroes)


09h GetToc
Params: None? Fetches the ToC from the disk, with a block size of 2064 bytes.


  CDVD Reads and Seeks

Seeking
If a read command is called, a seek must be performed. An IRQ is NOT raised when the seek finishes during a read command.
When a seek begins, if the drive is currently not spinning, it takes 333 ms for the drive to spin and finish the seek.
Otherwise, one of three seek modes is possible:
- Contiguous read: When the seek delta is very small or zero, seek time = block_timing * delta
- Fast seek: When seek delta < 14764 for DVD reads and < 4371 for CD reads, seek time = ~30 ms
- Full seek: Seek time = ~100 ms
block_timing (in IOP cycles) can be found by the following formula:

  block_timing = (IOP_CLOCK * block_size) / read_speed

Where IOP_CLOCK is ~36,864,000 Hz. read_speed for CD reads is 24 * 153600. For DVD reads read_speed = 4 * 1382400.
Unknown what delta is needed for a contiguous read (8/16 is used for CD/DVD respectively in PCSX2).

Reads
The time needed to read a single sector is the block_timing formula above. Once one sector has been read, the CDVD DMA channel can store the data in memory and allow the CDVD drive to continue.
When all sectors have been read, a CDVD IRQ is raised. Successful reads seem to raise both bits 1 AND 0 of CDVD I_STAT?


  CDVD S Commands

The results of an S command can be read one at a time from 1F402017h. All units are in bytes.

03h Subcommand
Params:

  0     Subcommand number

This is a prefix byte. Subcommands are listed below in the format of 03h:XXh.

03h:00h MechaconVersion
Params: None.
Result:

  0-3   MECHACON version

Unknown what the bytes mean. Newer versions of CDVDMAN do checks on them of some sort.
PCSX2 uses 00020603h as the version.

05h UpdateStickyFlags
Params: None.
Result:

  0     Update status (0=successful, 1=busy)

Sets 1F40200Bh to the value of 1F40200Ah. Used internally by CDVDMAN for detecting if a disk has been inserted.

08h ReadRTC
Params: None.

  5     Day
  6     Month
  7     Year

Returns the current time stored on the RTC, in BCD format.
The RTC is mostly just used by the BIOS. Notably, Metal Gear Solid 3 requires the RTC to boot. This is likely an anti-piracy feature.

Result:

  0     Update status (0=successful, 1=busy)

Sets 1F40200Bh to the value of 1F40200Ah. Used internally by CDVDMAN for detecting if a disk has been inserted.


15h ForbidDVD
Params: None.

40h OpenConfig
Params: None.
Opens the DVD drive configuration. Dobiestation returns zero

  Sound Processing Unit (SPU2)

SPU2 AutoDMA


  SPU2 AutoDMA

1F9001B0h+(core*400h) SPU_ADMA_CTRL

  0     On core0, 1=start ADMA write/ADMA busy. No effect on core1
  1     Same as above, but only works on core1
  2     Start ADMA read on this core (1=start ADMA read). Unknown how ADMA reads work

ADMA streams signed stereo 16-bit PCM audio to the MEMIN region, bypassing almost all SPU2 processing. In other words, ADMA allows games to stream raw audio without compression or special effects - this feature is usually used for music.
ADMA uses the normal DMA interface, and it is not possible to have both ADMA and a normal SPU DMA transfer active at the same time.

A full ADMA block is 1024 bytes, where the first 512 bytes are left channel samples, and the other half is the right channel. MEMIN is double-buffered, allowing the mixer hardware to read from one buffer while ADMA writes to another free buffer. Some games do upload blocks smaller than 1024 bytes, which partially fills the free buffer.


  PS2 Serial Port (SIO2)

SIO2 provides access to controllers and memory cards in PS2 mode, as well as other peripherals. While following a similar principle as the PSX's serial port (called SIO0 here), SIO2 is completely different in design.

  SIO2 Registers

A good portion of SIO2 is a mystery. Having no documentation whatsoever, its behavior has to be inferred from how programs use it.

1F808200h-1F80823Fh SIO2_SEND3 - Command Parameters

  0-1   Port
  8-16  Fake command length, not used by SIO2
  18-24 Real command length (counting peripheral byte)
  Other Unknown

SEND3 is an array of up to 16 different SIO2 commands. A command consists of a peripheral byte that selects to what the command is being sent, a command sent to the peripheral, and an arbitrary amount of data.

Known peripheral bytes:

    01h - Controller
    21h - Multitap
    61h - Infrared
    81h - Memory card

1F808240h-1F80825Fh SIO2_SEND1/SEND2 - Port1/2 Control?
Unknown purpose.
When bit 2 of the address is set, SEND2 is accessed. Otherwise, SEND1 is accessed.

1F808260h SIO2_FIFOIN - Data Write
A one-byte register used to upload commands to SIO2. The SIO2in DMA channel also writes to this register.

1F808264h SIO2_FIFOOUT - Data Read
Used to read replies and data from SIO2 peripherals after a command is sent. SIO2out reads from this register.

1F808268h SIO2_CTRL - Control Register
Bit 0 seems to start the command transfer. An SIO2 interrupt is raised after touching this bit, presumably when the command has completed.
Bits 2 and 3 reset SIO2, preparing it for another transfer.
Rest of the bits are unknown. They probably control bandwidths and interrupt masking, at the very least.

The SIO2MAN module in the BIOS sets this register to 3BCh on a reset.

1F80826Ch SIO2_RECV1 - Response Status 1 (R)
Set after a transfer, indicating if the peripheral is connected.
If (RECV1 & F000h) == 1000h after a memory card command, the memory card is connected. Else, disconnected.
If (RECV1 & 2000h) == 0 after a pad command, the pad is connected.

Known value for a disconnected peripheral is 1D100h. Known value for a connected peripheral is 1100h.

1F808270h SIO2_RECV2 - Response Status 2 (R)
Read by PADMAN. Always equal to 0xF?

1F808274h SIO2_RECV3 - Response Status 3 (R)
Unknown.

1F808280h SIO2_ISTAT? - Interrupt Flags?
SIO2MAN's interrupt handler reads from this and writes to it the value read. Not known what any of the bits represent.

SIO2MAN Program Flow For Transfer

  Write CTRL | 0Ch to CTRL.
  Write data to SEND1 and SEND2, then write data to SEND3.
  Write data to DATAIN if applicable, then start SIO2in and SIO2out DMA transfers if applicable.
  Write CTRL | 01h to CTRL, then wait for an SIO2 interrupt.
  After interrupt, read RECV1, RECV2, and RECV3, then read DATAOUT if applicable.



  SIO2 PS2 Memcards

Basic Info
A PS2 memory card uses flash memory. The main advantages are that it is cheap and does not require any power to retain information. The downsides are that accessing flash is much slower than RAM, and flash memory will go bad when written to too many times.
Flash also has some restrictions on how it can be written to. Depending on the card, individual bits can be changed from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, but not both. In order to flip a bit in the opposite direction, the entire block must be erased.
Official memory cards are 8 MB, but third-party cards can be larger than this. Certain games do not work if the memory card is larger than expected, for unknown reasons.
Commands
11h - Probe

  Command: 11 + 1 XX byte
  Reply: 2B + Terminator
  Length: 2 bytes

First command sent when trying to detect a card.
The terminator defaults to 55h on reset. Newer versions of MCMAN check for this.

12h - Unk12

  Command: 12 + 1 XX byte
  Reply: 2B + Terminator
  Length: 2 bytes

Unknown purpose. Sent on write/erase commands. Maybe some sort of flush?

21h - Start Erase
22h - Start Write
23h - Start Read

  Command: 21 + 4-byte sector address + 2 XX bytes
  Reply: 5 XX bytes + 2Bh + Terminator
  Length: 7 bytes

These commands prepare read/write/erase sector operations by providing a starting address in sectors.

26h - Get Specs

  Command: 26 + 10 XX bytes
  Reply: 2B + 2-byte sector size in bytes + 2-byte erase block size + 4-byte sector count + 1-byte checksum + Terminator
  Length: 11 bytes

Retrieves the card's capabilities. The total size of the memory card is (sector size + 16) * sectors (the 16 is space for error correction).
The checksum is an XOR between the individual bytes of sector size, erase blocks, and sectors.
A standard Sony 8 MB memory card will report the following.

  2B 00 02 10 00 00 40 00 00 52

That is to say, a sector size of 512 bytes, an erase block page count of 16 sectors, and a sector count of 16,384.

27h - Set Terminator

  Command: 27 + 1-byte new terminator + 1 XX byte
  Reply: XX + 2B + Old terminator
  Length: 3 bytes


28h - Get Terminator

Sent at the end of a read or write. Unknown purpose.

82h - Erase Block

  Command: 82 + 1 XX byte
  Reply: 2B + Terminator
  Length: 2 bytes

  SIO2 PS2 Memcard Filesystem

The PS2 uses a double-indirect indexed FAT filesystem to keep track of clusters. It also has support for ECC and bad block detection, depending on MCMAN version.
Superblock Format

  Byte      Name
  0-27      Magic string. Should contain "Sony PS2 Memory Card Format "
  28-39     Version string. Has the format "1.x.0.0", where x is the minor version
  40-41     Size in bytes of a page. Default 512
  42-43     Pages per cluster. Default 2
  44-45     Pages per erase block. Default 16
  46-47     Set to -256. Doesn't seem to be used
  48-51     Total clusters in the card. Default 8192
  52-55     Offset of the first allocatable cluster, in cluster units. Immediately after the FAT
  56-59     Offset of the cluster after the last allocatable cluster, relative to the first
  60-63     Offset of the root directory cluster, relative to the first. Should be 0
  64-67     Backup erase block. Should be the last block in the card, default 1023
  68-71     Second backup block, should be the second-last block in the card
  80-207    Array of 32 indirect FAT cluster indices. On a standard card, only one indirect cluster is used
  208-335   Array of 32 bad blocks, which cannot be used. -1 indicates no entry
  384       Memory card type. Should be 2, indicating a PS2 memory card
  385       Card flags. Default 52h
            Bit 0=ECC support if set
            Bit 3=Card has bad blocks
            Bit 4=Erased blocks have bits set to 0 if set

The superblock is located in the first page in the memory card.


  SIO2 Controller Commands

SIO2 communicates with the controller by sending sequences of bytes and receiving replies from the controller.
Note that the reply comes immediately after the appropriate byte has been sent, more specifically the reply bytes
are not queued.

Packets have a three byte header followed by an additional 2, 6 or 18 bytes of additional command and controller data
(like button states, vibration motor commands, button pressures, etc.).

Packet header

  Command: 01 + command byte + 00
  Reply: FF + depends on command + 5A
  Length: 3

The first byte is the peripheral byte sent by SIO2 and is always 01 for controllers. The reply is always FF. The command byte tells the peripheral which command to execute.
All commands reply with F3 except from commands 42 and 43 which reply with the mode byte (more details below). The third byte is always 00 and its reply is always 5A
Below is a list of known controller commands.

41h - Query Masked Mode

  Command: header + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A
  
  If in digital mode or a nonstandard controller:
  Reply: header reply + zero bytes
  
  If in analog or DS2 mode:
  Reply: header reply + 3 mask bytes + 00 + 00 + 5A
  Length: 8                                      +---- (last byte is always 0x5A)

This command is used to find out what buttons are included in poll responses. The controller can be configured (through command 0x4F) to respond with
more or less information about each button with each poll. If the controller is in digital mode (0x41) this commands returns zeroes.
Only works when the controller is already in configuration mode.

42h - Read Data

  Command: header + variable zero bytes
  
  If in digital mode or a nonstandard controller:
  Reply: header reply (returns mode byte) + 2 button state bytes
  Length: 4

  If in analog or DS2 mode:
  Reply: header reply (returns mode byte) + 2 button state bytes + 4 analog button state bytes + (optional) 12 button pressure bytes
  Length: 8 or 20 depending if analog button pressures are requested.

The format of controller inputs varies based not only on what is connected, but also what its current mode is. See the respective controller pages for their input formats.
The high nibble of the mode byte indicates the mode (0x4 is digital, 0x7 is analog, 0xF config / escape?), while the lower nibble is how many 16 bit words follow the header.
Known mode bytes returned by header are presented below:

  12h   Mouse
  23h   NeGcon
  41h   DualShock Digital
  73h   DualShock Analog
  79h   DualShock 2 (analog+pressure)
  F3h   In config mode


43h - Enter/Exit Config Mode

  Outside config mode:
  Command: header + 1 config byte (1=enter config) + zero bytes
  Reply: header reply (with mode byte) + same as Read Data (but without pressure values in DS2 mode)
  Length: Same as Read Data
  
  Inside config mode:
  Command: header + 1 config byte (0=exit config) + zero bytes
  Reply: header reply (with mode byte) + 6 zero bytes
  Length: 8

Config mode allows the controller state to be changed. When the controller is not in config mode, only commands 42h and 43h work.
When the controller is outside of config mode this command behaves the same as 42. If the command is in config mode is command can only be used to exit config mode.

45h - Query Model and Mode

  Command: header + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A
  Reply: header reply + model + 02 + analog + 02 + 01 + 00
  Length: 8

model=01h for Dualshock and 03 for Dualshock 2
analog=01h if the controller is in analog mode and 00h if in digital mode.

46h - Query Act

  Command: header + index + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A
  
  If index=0
  Reply: header reply + 00 + 00 + 01 + 02 + 00 + 0A
  
  If index=1
  Reply: header reply + 00 + 00 + 01 + 01 + 01 + 14
  
  Length: 8

This command is always issued twice in a row, and appears to be retrieving a 10 byte constant of over those two calls.
It is always called in a sequence of 46h 46h 47h 4Ch 4Ch. Only works after the controller is in config mode.

47h - Query Comb

  Command: header + 00 + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A
  Reply: header reply + 00 + 00 + 02 + 00 + 01 + 00
  Length: 8

Unknown purpose.

4Ch - Query Mode

  Command: header + index + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A + 5A
  Reply: header reply + 00 + 00 + 00 + val + 00 + 00
  Length: 8
  
  if index=0, val=4
  if index=1, val=7

Unknown purpose.

4Dh - Vibration Toggle

  Command: header + aa + bb + cc + dd + ee + ff
  Reply: header reply + .. old rumble values ..
  Length: 8

This command configures rumble, but it is unknown exactly how. Bytes aa-ff are used for this.
On reset, rumble values are all FFh.

  IOP Interrupts

Interrupt handling for the IOP is similar to its PSX counterpart. The main differences are an additional register (I_CTRL) and more interrupt lines.

1F801070h I_STAT - Interrupt status register (R=Status, W=Acknowledge)
1F801074h I_MASK - Interrupt mask register (R/W)
Status: Read I_STAT (1=IRQ raised)
Acknowledge: Write I_STAT (0=Clear bit 1=No effect)
Mask: Read/Write I_MASK (0=Disabled 1=Enabled)

  0     IRQ0   VBLANK start
  1     IRQ1   GPU (used in PSX mode)
  2     IRQ2   CDVD Drive
  3     IRQ3   DMA
  4     IRQ4   Timer 0
  5     IRQ5   Timer 1
  6     IRQ6   Timer 2
  7     IRQ7   SIO0
  8     IRQ8   SIO1
  9     IRQ9   SPU2
  10    IRQ10  PIO
  11    IRQ11  VBLANK end
  12    IRQ12  DVD? (unknown purpose)
  13    IRQ13  PCMCIA (related to DEV9 expansion slot)
  14    IRQ14  Timer 3
  15    IRQ15  Timer 4
  16    IRQ16  Timer 5
  17    IRQ17  SIO2

  21    IRQ21  HTR3?
  22    IRQ22  USB
  23    IRQ23  EXTR? (unknown purpose)
  24    IRQ24  FWRE (related to FireWire)
  25    IRQ25  FDMA? (FireWire DMA?)
  26-31 Unused/garbage


1F801078h I_CTRL - Global interrupt control (R=Status and Disable, W)

  0     Enable all interrupts
  1-31  Unused/garbage

When bit 0=1, all IOP interrupts are enabled. Reading this register returns bit 0 AND clears it, disabling interrupts. Writing can set or reset bit 0.

Raising Interrupts
If I_CTRL && (I_STAT & I_MASK), then COP0.Cause:8 is set. When COP0.Status:8 is also set when this occurs, COP0.Cause.Excode is set to 00h and the IOP jumps to 80000080h, where the interrupt will be processed.


  IOP DMA

The IOP re-uses the same DMA channels found in the PSX, and it contains additional channels for new peripherals.

Channels

  Old channels
  1F80108xh  0   MDECin
  1F80109xh  1   MDECout
  1F8010Axh  2   SIF2 (EE<->IOP, GPU in PSX mode)
  1F8010Bxh  3   CDVD (CDROM in PSX mode)

  1F80153xh  10  SIF1 (EE->IOP)
  1F80154xh  11  SIO2in
  1F80155xh  12  SIO2out


1F801xx0h+N*10h Dn_MADR

  0-23  Start address of transfer in RAM
  24-31 Unused, zero


1F801xx4h+N*10h Dn_BCR

  0-15  Block size in words (0=0x10000)
  16-31 Block count


1F801xx8h+N*10h Dn_CHCR

  0     Transfer direction (0=to RAM, 1=from RAM)
  1     MADR increment per step (0=+4, 1=-4)
  2-7   Unused
  8     When 1:
        -Burst mode: enable "chopping" (cycle stealing by CPU)
        -Slice mode: Causes DMA to hang
        -Linked-list/Chain mode: Transfer header/tag before data
  9-10  Transfer mode
        0=Burst (transfer data all at once, only low 16 bits of BCR are valid)
        1=Slice (transfer in units of BCR blocks and arbitrate)
        2=Linked-list mode
        3=Chain mode (uses TADR)
  11    Unknown, used by iLink DMA
  12-15 Unused

  19    Unused
  20-22 Chopping CPU window size (1 << N cycles)
  23    Unused
  24    Start transfer (0=stopped/completed, 1=start/busy)
  28    Force transfer start without waiting for DREQ
  29    In forced-burst mode, pauses transfer while set.
        In other modes, stops bit 28 from being cleared after a slice is transferred.
        No effect when transfer was caused by a DREQ.
  30    Perform bus snooping (allows DMA to read from IOP cache?)
  31    iLink automatic response - unknown purpose


1F801xxCh+N*10h Dn_TADR

  0-23  Start address of list of tags
  24-31 Unused, zero

TADR is used in chain mode. At the start of a chain transfer, a tag will be read from TADR, and TADR will be incremented by the size of the tag, which is either 2 or 4 words.

Chain Mode Tag Format

  0-23  Start address of transfer in RAM
  30    IRQ - raises IQE interrupt in DICR2 when all words in this tag are transferred
  31    End of transfer, raises transfer completion interrupt
  32-55 Size of transfer in words
  
  ... Optionally 2 words to transfer after tag ...

If Dn_CHCR.8 is set, 2 words after the tag in memory (TADR + 8) will be transferred first. This is used by SIF0 to transfer a DMAtag to the EE's DMAC.
Only the SIF0, SIF1, and SPU1 channels can use tag mode. SIF0 and SIF1 use it exclusively, but it is unknown whether anything uses chain mode on SPU1.

1F8010F0h DPCR - DMA Priority/Enable

  Each 4 bits correspond to a channel.
  Bits 0-2 are priority, where 0=highest and 7=lowest. If two channels have the same priority, priority is determined by channel number, where higher channels have higher
  priority.
  Bit 3 is a channel enable, 0=disable, 1=enable.
  0-3   Channel 0 (MDECin)
  4-7   Channel 1 (MDECout)
  8-11  Channel 2 (SIF2)
  12-15 Channel 3 (CDVD)
  16-19 Channel 4 (SPU1)
  20-23 Channel 5 (PIO)
  24-27 Channel 6 (OTC)
  28-31 Channel 'C' (CPU priority. Bit 31 has no effect)

  Initial value on PS2 reset is 0x07777777. Initial value on PSX reset is 0x07654321.


1F801570h DPCR2 - DMA Priority/Enable 2

  Works similarly to DPCR.
  
  0-3   Channel 7   (SPU2)
  4-7   Channel 8   (DEV9)
  8-11  Channel 9   (SIF0)
  12-15 Channel 10  (SIF1)
  16-19 Channel 11  (SIO2in)
  20-23 Channel 12  (SIO2out)
  24-27 Channel 'U' (USB DMA, controlled through USB registers)
  28-31 Unknown


1F8010F4h DICR - DMA Interrupt Register

  0-6   Controls channel 0-6 completion interrupts in bits 24-30.
        When 0, an interrupt only occurs when the entire transfer completes.
        When 1, interrupts can occur for every slice and linked-list transfer.
        No effect if the interrupt is masked by bits 16-22.
  7-14  Unused
  15    Bus error flag. Raised when transferring to/from an address outside of RAM. Forces bit 31 to be set.
  16-22 Channel 0-6 interrupt mask. If enabled, channels cause interrupts as per bits 0-6.
  23    Master channel interrupt enable.
  24-30 Channel 0-6 interrupt flags. Writing 1 clears a flag.
        IMPORTANT: The flag only gets raised if the interrupt is enabled! INTRMAN relies on this behavior.
  31    Master interrupt flag. When set, IRQ 3 is sent to the IOP's INTC.
        DICR.31 = DICR.15 | (DICR.23 && (DICR.24-30 || DICR2.24-29)


1F801574h DICR2 - DMA Interrupt Register 2

  0-12  Interrupt on tag bit. Corresponds to channels 0-12, but only bits 4, 9, and 10 can be set - this corresponds to SPU1, SIF0, and SIF1.
        When set, an interrupt is raised on an IRQ tag when the tag transfer completes.
        NOTE: This works independently of the channel's interrupt mask, so a tag interrupt can still happen even when the transfer interrupt is disabled.
  13-15 Unused
  16-21 Channel 7-12 interrupt mask. If enabled, channels cause interrupts upon transfer completion.
  22-23 Unused
  24-29 Channel 7-12 interrupt flags. Works same as DICR interrupt flags, including being masked by DICR.23
  30-31 Unused


1F801578h DMACEN - Global DMA Enable

  0     0=All transfers disabled
        1=All transfers enabled

This register can be safely accessed while DMA is ongoing.

1F80157Ch DMACINTEN - Global DMA Interrupt Control

  0     When 0, all channel interrupts disabled. Master interrupt flag is 0 in all cases but bus error interrupts.
  1     When 1, DMA interrupts disabled - IRQ 3 is never sent to INTC. Does not affect master interrupt flag.



  IOP Timers

1F801100h+N*10h Timer 0..2 count (R/W)

  0-15  Current value
  16-31 Unused/garbage

1F801480h+(N-3)*10h Timer 3..5 count (R/W)

  0-31  Current value

Timers 0..5 increment automatically. 0..2 are 16-bit, and 3..5 are 32-bit. Writes set the counter to the value written.

1F801104h+N*10h Timer 0..2 mode (R/W)
1F801484h+(N-3)*10h Timer 3..5 mode (R/W)

  0     Gate enable
  1-2   Gate mode
  3     Zero return - reset counter on interrupt
  4     Compare interrupt enabled
  5     Overflow interrupt enabled
  6     Repeat interrupt - if unset, bit 10 is set to 0 after interrupt occurs.
  7     LEVL - toggle bit 10 on IRQs if bit 6 is set.
  8     Use external signal
        If set:
          Timer 0: pixel clock (13.5 MHz regardless of screen mode)
          Timer 1/3: HBLANK
          Others: sysclock (no effect)
  9     Timer 2 prescaler
  10    Interrupts enabled (R)
  11    Compare interrupt raised (R)
  12    Overflow interrupt raised (R)
  13-14 Timer 4/5 prescalar
  15-31 Unused/garbage

Writes to mode reset the count to zero and set bit 10 to 1. Reads from mode clear the two raised interrupt flags.
Prescalers adjust clockrate as follows:

  0     normal
  1     1/8 speed
  2     1/16 speed
  3     1/256 speed


1F801108h+N*10h Timer 0..2 target (R/W)

  0-15  Value
  16-31 Unused/garbage

1F801488h+(N-3)*10h Timer 3..5 target (R/W)

  0-31  Value

When count == target, a compare interrupt is raised. This raises an IRQ in I_STAT if both mode.4 and mode.10 are enabled.
If mode.7 (LEVL) is not set, writes to target set mode.10 to 1.

  IOP Console

The IOP uses multiple addresses when printing output to the console. Registers $a1 and $a2 are used to store the string address in memory and its size respectively.

  if (PC == 0x12C48 || PC == 0x1420C || PC == 0x1430C)
  {
      uint32_t pointer = gpr[5];
      uint32_t text_size = gpr[6];
      while (text_size)
      {
          auto c = (char)ram[pointer & 0x1FFFFF];
          putc(c);
          
          pointer++;
          text_size--;
      }
  }



  Subsystem Interface (SIF)

The SIF is how the EE and IOP communicate with each other. SIF has some mailbox hardware registers that the CPUs can use to pass values to each other, which happens during SIF initialization. However, once both sides have booted, they use the SIF0 (IOP->EE) and SIF1 (EE->IOP) DMA channels to communicate.

  SIF Registers

Note: EE base is at 1000F200h, IOP base is at 1D000000h.

1000F200h/1D000000h SIF_MSCOM (Only writable by EE)
1000F210h/1D000010h SIF_SMCOM (Only writable by IOP)

  0-31  Value

These registers could be used for generic communication, but in the PS2 they are used to tell the other side the address of its DMA receive buffer. For example, the EE places its SIF0 receive address in MSCOM so that the IOP knows where to transfer data to, and the opposite is true for SMCOM.

1000F220h/1D000020h SIF_MSFLG (IOP writes mask)
1000F230h/1D000030h SIF_SMFLG (EE writes mask)

  0-31  Value

These registers are used like semaphores. The following values are used:

  10000h: SIF DMA/hardware initialized
  20000h: SIFCMD initialized
  40000h: IOP has finished booting (sent by EESYNC)

If the EE sends 20000h to MSFLG, the IOP can read this and clear MSFLG by writing 20000h to it. The opposite is true for SMFLG.

1000F240h/1D000040h SIF_CTRL

  1     Always 1?
  8     Always 1 for EE, 0 for IOP?
  28-31 Always 0xF?
  Other Unknown

Very little is known about this register.

1000F260h/1D000060h SIF_BD6

  0-31  Unknown

Nothing is known about this register, other than that it does get accessed during initialization.


  SIF DMA

During SIF initialization and after bootup the EE and IOP can use DMA to send data to each other. This is achieved using a set of fifos (First In First Out) located in the SIF, refered to as SIF0 and SIF1.
Assume that the EE wants to send data to the IOP:

- The EE writes the data it wants to send to RAM, alongside with respective DMA tags
- It calls SifSetDma to initialize a SIF1 transfer to the IOP
- The DMAC starts writing qwords to the SIF1 fifo
- After the data is transfered, the IOP starts a SIF1 transfer and reads the data in the fifo
- Finally an interrupt is asserted on DICR/DICR2 and if that mask is also set, an IOP
interrupt is triggered.

Note that if a SIF0/SIF1 transfer is started on either component and the fifo is empty the transfer continues running until the respective fifo starts filling with data. In addition this process relies hevily on interrupts and DICR flag writing to work.


  SIF RPC Basics

Broadly, the SIF protocol can be split into three different layers of abstraction, from lowest to highest:

    SIF DMA: Accesses raw hardware registers to transfer data between the EE and IOP.
    SIF CMD: Manages interrupt handling, allowing programs to send commands to the other side.
    SIF RPC: Defines a server/client interface around SIF CMD, allowing programs to call functions on the other side as if they were part of the program. For example, from the game's perspective, sceMcWrite is like any other function, even though internally it has to send a request to the IOP to access the memory card.

Calling RPC functions
Assume that a game on the EE wants to open a file.

    The EE client sends a BIND request to the IOP. To do this, the game must know the ID of the server it wants to bind to. Since it is trying to open a file, it would use 0x80000001, the ID of FILEIO.
    The IOP receives the request and looks up the server struct associated with the ID.
    The IOP finds the server and sends an END packet to the EE. This contains a pointer to the IOP server, along with some other information. After receiving the END reply, the EE client can now call FILEIO functions.
    The EE sends a CALL request to the IOP. The IOP receives this and wakes up the RPC thread associated with the server, passing the function number, data buffer, and size of the data to the RPC thread.
    FILEIO executes the open command and returns a result. The IOP sends an END packet to the EE, and it can optionally directly DMA the result of the RPC command to a different buffer. In this case, it would be a file descriptor ID.

In more succinct terms, the EE first uses SifBindRpc to bind the server to the client, then it uses SifCallRpc to call an IOP function.

Registering an RPC server
Servers can be registered on both the EE and the IOP. In the vast majority of cases however, only IOP modules register servers.

    Create a new thread, which will be used by the server. All actions below are done on the new thread.
    Call SifSetRpcQueue first and then SifRegisterRpc to register the server.
    Finally, call SifRpcLoop. This puts the server thread to sleep until a new SIF RPC request arrives.

The above creates a dedicated server thread, which can only be used for SIF RPC. If non-blocking execution is desired for whatever reason, one can use SifGetNextRequest and SifExecRequest.

  SIF RPC Commands

80000000h Change SADDR

  struct SifSaddrPkt
  {
    struct SifCmdHeader header;
    void* buff;
  }

This just changes the EE's receive buffer on the IOP side. Used when SifInitRpc is called more than once.

80000001h Set SREG

  struct SifCmdSRegData
  {
    SifCmdHeader header;
    int	index;
    uint value;
  }

Sets a software SIF register - that is, a variable in memory rather than an I/O register.
Used by the IOP during SIF RPC initialization to tell the EE what the IOP has stored for the EE's receive buffer.

80000002h SIFCMD Init

  struct SifInitPkt
  {
    struct SifCmdHeader header; //NOTE: The "opt" field is used by the IOP.
    void* buff;
  }

This command is sent twice by the EE during SIFRPC initialization, the first with opt=0 and the second with opt=1.
When opt=0, buff is used as the EE's SIF0 receive address, and the IOP sets SMFLG to 20000h.
When opt=1, the IOP finishes SIFRPC initialization.

80000003h Reboot IOP

  struct SifIopResetPkt
  {
    struct SifCmdHeader header;
    int	arglen; //Length of the command
    int	mode; //Bit 31 enables debug logging, unknown what other values do
    char arg[80]; //The command to be passed to MODLOAD
  }

See BIOS IOP REBOOT for details on the reboot procedure.

80000008h Request End

struct SifRpcRendPkt
{
   struct SifCmdHeader sifcmd;
   int rec_id;
   void	*pkt_addr;
   int rpc_id;
   struct SifRpcClientData *client;

     int rec_id;	
     void *pkt_addr;
     int rpc_id;
     struct SifRpcClientData *client;
     int rpc_number; //ID of the function to call on the server
     int send_size; //Size of data to send to the server
     void *receive; //Buffer to hold reply data from the server
     int recv_size; //Size of reply buffer
     int rmode;
     struct SifRpcServerData *server;
  }


8000000Ch Get other data

  struct SifRpcOtherDataPkt
  {
     struct SifCmdHeader sifcmd;
     int rec_id;
     void *pkt_addr;
     int rpc_id;

     struct SifRpcReceiveData *receive;
     void *src;
     void *dest;
     int size;
  }

Used by a server to request more data from a client, which replies with an END packet.


  SIF RPC System Servers

  BIOS

The PS2 BIOS resides in a 4 MB ROM. Its purpose is to initialize hardware into a usable state, provide EE services and IOP modules, and launch PS2/PSX games.

BIOS IOP Modules
Unlike the EE, the IOP does not have a monolithic kernel. Instead, the kernel and device drivers are split into many modules.
These modules are represented as IRX files, which are custom relocatable ELFs.

BIOS IOP Module Linking
BIOS List of IOP Modules


  BIOS File Structure

The BIOS consists of dozens of separate files. These files are indexed and accessed through ROMDIR.
Each ROMDIR entry has the following format.

  struct romdir_entry
  {
    char name[10]; //File name, must be null terminated
    ushort ext_info_size; //Size of the file's extended info in EXTINFO
    uint file_size; //Size of the file itself
  }

First four entries in an SCPH-39001 ROMDIR:

  0x00002740: 52455345 54000000 00000C00 40270000      RESET
  0x00002750: 524F4D44 49520000 00005400 D0050000      ROMDIR
  0x00002760: 45585449 4E464F00 00000000 80070000      EXTINFO
  0x00002770: 524F4D56 45520000 00000000 10000000      ROMVER
  ...

To find the start of ROMDIR, look for the first occurrence of "RESET" in the BIOS.
To find a specific file in the BIOS, find its entry in ROMDIR and then add the file sizes of all previous files to get the starting address.


  BIOS Boot Process

Upon reset, both the EE and IOP begin executing at BFC00000h. The BIOS checks which CPU is executing by checking COP0.PRid (register 15). If PRid >= 59h, the EE boot code is executed. Else, the IOP boot code is executed.

EE boot process
- The EE clock speed is measured. (SCPH-10000 uses COP0.Count; SCPH-39001 counts HBLANKs using one of the timers. Unknown what other BIOSes use.)
- The memory controller is initialized, giving access to the 32 MB of RDRAM.
- The EE kernel is copied into RAM starting at virtual address 80000000h. The BIOS jumps to the entry point at 80001000h.
- The TLB and PGIF handler are initialized and various hardware components are reset.
- EENULL, an idle loop thread, is loaded into 00081FC0h.
- SIF DMA is initialized. The EE writes to an SIF register and waits for a reply from the IOP.
- The EELOAD module is loaded, which in turn loads OSDSYS.

OSDSYS, once loaded, is responsible for bringing up the "Sony Computer Entertainment" screen and the browser.

IOP boot process
- Various hardware registers are initialized, and IOPBOOT is loaded.
- IOPBOOT finds SYSMEM and LOADCORE, loads them into memory, and executes their entry points.
- LOADCORE boots all of the IOP modules in the BIOS, starting with EXCEPMAN.
- At some point, SIF is initialized. The IOP waits for the EE to send a message and replies over another SIF register.
- Once all modules have been loaded, the IOP enters an infinite loop, waiting for the EE to send commands.


  BIOS EE Threading

The EE kernel uses a cooperative priority-based thread scheduler. It can support up to 256 threads and 256 semaphores. 128 priority levels are available.

Structs

  struct ThreadParam //Used as argument for CreateThread, ReferThreadStatus
  {
    int status;

    int max_count;
    int attr;
    int option;
    int wait_threads;
    struct TCB *wait_next, *wait_prev;
  }


Thread Scheduler
The kernel uses an array of 128 doubly-linked lists for managing thread priorities. The general algorithm for the scheduler is as follows:

  void reschedule(uint32 EPC, uint32 stack)
    Set current thread entry function to EPC (instruction after exception)
    Set current thread stack base to stack
    Set current thread status to READY
    Loop through active thread priority list, starting from 0 (highest priority)
      If an active thread is found, set current thread to it and break
      If no active thread is found, print an error and call Exit(1)
    Set found thread's status to RUN and return its entry function and stack pointer

Scheduling is only invoked by syscalls and relies on absolute priority. Threads with lower priority will never run as long as there is an active thread with higher priority.
When the BIOS receives an interrupt, it will save the GPR registers into a buffer, so that the interrupt can be served without destroying the thread state. However, when a thread is paused (ie. yields the CPU) its CPU context is placed on the user stack using the context described above.

Semaphores
Threads that call WaitSema on a semaphore with a "count" of zero are placed in a WAIT state and removed from the active thread list.
Conversely, calling SignalSema re-adds a thread waiting on a semaphore to the active list.
Semaphores are useful for blocking execution of a thread until a task completes. Sony's official SIF protocol, for instance, use a semaphore to place the caller thread to sleep while the IOP processes a request. The caller thread is reactivated in the SIF interrupt handler.


  BIOS EE Syscalls

When a SYSCALL instruction is executed, the EE jumps to 80000180h and sets COP0.Cause to 08h. The kernel syscall handler retrieves the syscall number from the v1 register.
Negative syscalls use the current thread's stack for internal operations and are meant to be used in interrupt handlers. Positive syscalls use the kernel stack, and some of them can trigger thread reschedules.

List of EE Syscalls
01h void ResetEE(int reset_flag)
Resets EE components depending on which bits are set in reset_flag:

  0 - DMAC
  1 - VU1
  2 - VIF1
  3 - GIF
  4 - VU0
  5 - VIF0
  6 - IPU

NOTE: INTC is reset regardless of the flag's settings.

02h void SetGsCrt(bool interlaced, int display_mode, bool frame)
Initializes the PCRTC.

04h void Exit(int status)
Returns to the OSDSYS browser. Internally calls LoadExecPS2("rom0:OSDSYS", 1, "BootBrowser").

05h void _ExceptionEpilogue/RFU005()
Internal syscall used by kernel exception handlers. Returns to the user program.

06h void LoadExecPS2(const char* filename, int argc, char** argv)
Loads an ELF with the specified arguments and executes it. This function also clears all of the internal kernel state, such as threads and semaphores, before execution.
This function does not (and must not) return.

07h void ExecPS2(void* entry, void* gp, int argc, char** argv)
Clears all of the internal kernel state and creates a thread with priority 0 (main thread). The thread begins executing from the entry point.
This function does not (and must not) return.

10h int AddIntcHandler(int int_cause, int (*handler)(int), int next, void* arg, int flag)
Adds an interrupt handler with the specified cause to a queue. This function returns the id of the handler or -1 if the operation fails. int_cause corresponds to a bit in INTC_STAT/INTC_MASK. For example, int_cause=2 will register a VBLANK handler.
next is a previously registered handler id which this handler will be placed before. next==0 will place the handler in front of the queue, and next==-1 will place it at the back of the queue.
arg and flag are stored in the handler struct but don't seem to be used otherwise?

11h int RemoveIntcHandler(int int_cause, int handler_id)
Removes the handler associated with the interrupt cause. Returns -1 if the operation fails.

12h int AddDmacHandler(int dma_cause, int (*handler)(int), int next, void* arg, int flag)
Adds an interrupt handler for INT1 (DMAC) interrupts. Otherwise works the same as AddIntcHandler.

13h int RemoveDmacHandler(int dma_cause, int handler_id)
Works same as RemoveIntcHandler.

14h bool _EnableIntc(int cause_bit)
Enables the indicated bit in INTC_MASK. Returns true if this bit was set to 0 and false if it was already set to 1.

15h bool _DisableIntc(int cause_bit)
Disables the indicated bit in INTC_MASK. Returns true if this bit was set to 1 and false if it was already set to 0.

16h bool _EnableDmac(int cause_bit)
Same as _EnableIntc, but for D_STAT's mask.

17h bool _DisableDmac(int cause_bit)
Same as _DisableIntc, but for D_STAT's mask.

20h int CreateThread(ThreadParam* t)
Creates a thread with DORMANT status. The thread is not placed in the priority linked-list.
Only t->func, t->initial_priority, t->stack, t->stack_size, and t->gp_reg are used. The new thread re-uses the heap of its parent thread.
Returns the id of the newly created thread, or -1 if the function fails.

21h void DeleteThread(int thread_id)
Deletes a thread. The function only succeeds if the thread has DORMANT status and is not the current thread.

22h void StartThread(int thread_id, void* arg)
Adds a DORMANT thread to the active thread list and gives it READY status, forcing a thread reschedule. arg is intended to be used by the callee thread if it becomes the current thread.
The function fails if the thread is the current thread or is not DORMANT.

23h void ExitThread()
Removes the current thread from the active thread list, resets it, and gives it DORMANT status, forcing a thread reschedule.

24h void ExitDeleteThread()
Deletes the current thread, forcing a thread reschedule.

25h void TerminateThread(int thread_id)
Has different behavior depending on the thread's status:

  No status (0), RUN, DORMANT - No effect.
  READY - Removes thread from active thread list, resets it, and gives it DORMANT status, forcing a thread reschedule.
  WAIT, WAITSUSPEND - Same as READY but also decrements the thread's semaphore's "wait_threads" by one.
  All other statuses - Resets the thread and gives the thread DORMANT status, forcing a thread reschedule.


26h void iTerminateThread(int thread_id)
Same as TerminateThread, but does not force a thread reschedule. Used internally by TerminateThread.
Returns -1 if unsuccessful.

29h int ChangeThreadPriority(int thread_id, int priority)
Changes the thread's priority, forcing a thread reschedule. If thread_id==0, the current thread's id is used.
This function fails if the thread is DORMANT.

2Ah int iChangeThreadPriority(int thread_id, int priority)
Same as ChangeThreadPriority, but does not force a thread reschedule. Used internally by RotateThreadReadyQueue.
Returns -1 upon a failure, or the thread's old priority on a success.

2Bh void RotateThreadReadyQueue(int priority)
Rotates the threads in the given priority's linked list, forcing a thread reschedule. This allows different threads of the same priority level to execute.

2Ch int _iRotateThreadReadyQueue(int priority)
Same as RotateThreadReadyQueue, but does not force a thread reschedule. Used internally by ChangeThreadPriority.
Returns -1 upon a failure, or the given priority on a success.

2Dh void ReleaseWaitThread(int thread_id)
If the thread has WAIT status, it is given READY status and added to the active thread list. If it has WAITSUSPEND status, it is given SUSPEND status.
Both (and only) these cases force a thread reschedule. The reference to the thread's semaphore is also removed.

2Eh int iReleaseWaitThread(int thread_id)
Same as ReleaseWaitThread, but does not force a thread reschedule. Internally used by ReleaseWaitThread.
Returns -1 if unsuccessful.

2Fh int GetThreadId()
Returns the current thread's id.

30h int ReferThreadStatus(int thread_id, ThreadParam* status)
31h int iReferThreadStatus(int thread_id, ThreadParam* status)
Fills out the ThreadParam struct with the given thread's information. Returns -1 if unsuccessful.
The "i" variant performs exactly the same function.

32h void SleepThread()
If the current thread's "wakeup_count" is greater than zero, it is decremented. Else, if the thread status is RUN or READY, the current thread is removed from the active thread list and set to WAIT, forcing a thread reschedule.

33h void WakeupThread(int thread_id)
Has different behavior depending on the thread's status:

  WAIT (sleeping) - Set to READY and re-added to active thread list, forcing a thread reschedule.
  WAITSUSPEND (sleeping) - Placed in SUSPEND status, forcing a thread reschedule.
  READY, SUSPEND, WAIT/WAITSUSPEND (semaphore) - Increments "wakeup_count", forcing a thread reschedule.
  Other statuses - No effect.


34h int iWakeupThread(int thread_id)
Same as WakeupThread, but does not force a thread reschedule. Internally used by WakeupThread.
Returns -1 if unsuccessful.

35h int CancelWakeupThread(int thread_id)
36h int iCancelWakeupThread(int thread_id)

37h int SuspendThread(int thread_id)
38h int iSuspendThread(int thread_id)
Has different behavior depending on the thread's status:

  READY, RUN - Removed from active thread list and placed in SUSPEND status.
  WAIT - Placed in WAITSUSPEND status.
  All other statuses - No effect.

Returns -1 on failure or thread_id otherwise.
BUG: This function does NOT force a thread reschedule! If the current thread is suspended, it will continue to run!

39h void ResumeThread(int thread_id)
Has different behavior depending on the thread's status:

  SUSPEND - Placed in READY or RUN status and added to active thread list, forcing a thread reschedule.
  WAITSUSPEND - Placed in WAIT status, forcing a thread reschedule.
  All other statuses - No effect


3Ah int iResumeThread(int thread_id)
Same as ResumeThread, but does not force a thread reschedule. Internally used by ResumeThread.
Returns -1 if unsuccessful or thread_id otherwise.

3Bh void JoinThread()

3Ch void* InitMainThread/RFU060(uint32 gp, void* stack, int stack_size, char* args, int root)
Initializes the current thread. Returns the stack pointer of the thread.
If stack == -1, the stack pointer equals the end of RDRAM - stack_size. Else, it equals stack + stack_size.
This function should only be called before the program's main function.

3Dh void* InitHeap/RFU061(void* heap, int heap_size)
Initializes the current thread's heap. If heap == -1, the end of the heap resides at the thread's stack pointer. Else, the end of the heap is heap + heap_size.
Returns the end of the thread's heap.

3Eh void* EndOfHeap()
Returns the current thread's heap base.

40h int CreateSema(SemaParam* s)
Creates a semaphore. Returns the semaphore's id if successful and -1 if not.
Only s->init_count and s->max_count need to be specified. s->attr and s->option may also be specified.

41h int DeleteSema(int sema_id)
Deletes the semaphore, forcing a thread reschedule. Threads waiting on the semaphore will either be released or suspended, depending on their status.

42h int SignalSema(int sema_id)
Signals a semaphore. If a thread has called WaitSema on this semaphore, this forces a thread rescheduling. Otherwise, the semaphore's count is incremented by one.
Returns -1 if unsuccessful.

43h int iSignalSema(int sema_id)
Similar to SignalSema, except this does not reschedule threads. The semaphore's threads are simply re-added to the active thread list.
This function is called internally by SignalSema. Returns -1 if unsuccessful and -2 if the thread is released from its wait state.

44h void WaitSema(int sema_id)
If the semaphore's "count" variable > 0, count is decremented. Else, a thread rescheduling occurs, changing the active thread. The caller thread's status is set to WAIT.

45h int PollSema(int sema_id)
46h int iPollSema(int sema_id)
Decrements the semaphore's count variable. Returns -1 if unsuccessful.

64h void FlushCache(int mode)

  Modes of operation
  mode=0: Flush data cache (invalidate+writeback dirty contents to memory)
  mode=1: Invalidate data cache
  mode=2: Invalidate instruction cache
  All other modes invalidate both caches.


70h uint64_t GsGetIMR()
Returns the value of the privileged register GS_IMR.

71h void GsPutIMR(uint64_t value)
Sets GS_IMR to the value.

73h void SetVSyncFlag(int* vsync_occurred, u64* csr_stat_on_vsync)
Sets two kernel pointers that are used in the default INTC interrupt handler when a VSYNC interrupt has occurred.
If vsync_occurred is not NULL, the handler sets the value pointed to by vsync_occurred to 1.
If both pointers are not NULL, the value pointed to by csr_stat_on_vsync is set to GS_CSR.

A good use of this syscall is to retrieve the even/odd interlacing field in GS_CSR as early as possible.

74h void SetSyscall/RFU116(int index, int address)
Replaces an entry on the syscall table with the specified address.
This function does not perform any bounds checking.

76h int SifDmaStat(unsigned int dma_id)
Returns a positive value if the SIF transfer is queued, 0 if the transfer is in progress, and a negative value if the transfer has completed.

77h unsigned int SifSetDma(SifDmaTransfer* trans, int len)
Low-level syscall for starting SIF1 transfers. The format of SifDmaTransfer is as follows.

  struct SifDmaTransfer //Internal semaphore structure
  {
    void* src; //EE source
    void* dest; //IOP destination
    int size; //Size in bytes
    int attr;
  }

The len parameter is how large the SifDmaTransfer array is. Multiple SIF1 transfers are queued by the kernel.
This function returns the ID of the current transfer. It does not wait for the transfer to complete.

78h void SifSetDChain()
Initializes the SIF0 channel by resetting QWC and setting CHCR to 184h (channel busy, chain mode, TTE bit in tag enabled).

7Bh void ExecOSD(int argc, char** argv)
Shorthand for LoadExecPS2("rom0:OSDSYS", argc, argv).

7Dh void PSMode()

7Eh int MachineType()

7Fh int GetMemorySize()
Returns the amount of RDRAM on the console in bytes.


  BIOS EE Patches

The EE kernel is full of bugs, so games have to work around them. Both the official SDK and PS2SDK patch the alarm functions and certain threading functions before the main function is executed.

Alarm Patches
Using SetSyscall, games first set syscall 5Ah to be a memcpy with kernel privileges. 5Ah is then used to copy the real patch and EENULL to 80076000h and 00082000h respectively.
The patch contains syscalls FCh-FFh, which are SetAlarm, iSetAlarm, ReleaseAlarm, and iReleaseAlarm respectively. It also patches the interrupt handler for timer 3 (INTC12) by setting "syscall" 12Ch, which is out of bounds.

Threading Patches
iWakeupThread and iSuspendThread do not work properly when used on the currently executing thread, or its priority in the case of iRotateThreadReadyQueue.
While not technically a patch, games resolve this by creating a "top thread" whose purpose is to redirect these interrupt syscalls to their non-interrupt variants, which forces thread reschedules.


  BIOS PlayStation Compatibility

EE Side
In PSX mode, the EE and GS work together to emulate the PSX GPU. PS1DRV, a standard ELF, handles this emulation.
The main emulation loop of PS1DRV acts as a translation layer between PSX and GS commands. It polls PGIF registers to know when a command has arrived.

After OSDSYS detects a PSX disc, it loads PS1DRV and jumps to it. The setup for PSX mode is as follows.

    PS1DRV attempts to parse several hack databases. First, it parses an internal list of games stored in the executable. Next, if the PSX disc has a "PSD1.0.0" entry in SYSTEM.CNF, PS1DRV parses hacks from there. Finally, PS1DRV will attempt to open "BIDATA-SYSTEM/TITLE.DB" on both memory card ports. If one of them is opened successfully, it then parses the database. Unknown what the format of the SYSTEM.CNF and TITLE.DB hacks are.
    Some parameters are retrieved using GetOsdConfigParam and GetGsVParam. They are used to control factors like CDROM read speed and texture filtering.
    Various system registers are reset. PS1DRV also seems to remap SPU2 registers to their original PSX address base at 1F801C00h using SSBUS writes.
    Bit 19 is set in SIF_CTRL. This is probably to assert the reset line on the IOP, switching it to PSX mode. PS1DRV waits 1000000h ticks, then unsets bit 19, which probably deasserts the reset line, allowing the IOP to run. It then waits another 1000000h ticks.
    PS1DRV enters its emulation loop and waits for GPU commands to be sent.

IOP Side
TBIN is the PSX BIOS driver stored in the PS2 BIOS. It lacks the shell and jumps directly to the PS logo when loading a game. Unknown what other differences exist compared to real PSX models.
RESET will jump to TBIN if COP0.PRid is less than 0Fh or if I/O register 1F801570.3 is set. Unknown which one is true after the PS2->PSX transition, or if both are true after that.
Unknown what TBIN means. A string in it says "PS compatible mode by M.T.", which most likely refers to a person. If that is the case, TBIN could mean T's Binary, whoever T is.

The most significant change when transitioning to PSX mode is that the IOP is underclocked to 33.8688 MHz, the original speed of the PSX. SPU2 also outputs samples at 44.1 KHz, rather than 48 KHz.

Hacks
The overhead of translating GPU commands, combined with the GS being far, far faster than the PSX GPU, means that the emulator will have different timings from a real PSX. Some PSX games are exceptionally sensitive to timings, so the emulator is able to apply various hacks. All hacks are listed below. Note that the hacks aren't actually given names, so they are made up here.

    Render Polygon Delay
    Render Rectangle Delay
    Force CDROM speed: When greater than 2, this overwrites the speed setting set in OSDSYS.
    GP0 Increased Sync: Makes the emulator spend more time polling the GP0 FIFO directly, allowing it to respond faster to incoming data.
    VRAM Read Delay
    VBLANK Delay: Adds extra scanlines to emulated frame time, making emulated VBLANK interrupts take more time to occur.
    Timer Delay: Makes the emulator not do anything until timer 0's counter is equal to or greater than this value plus 4.
    Misc. Render Hack
    Bit 0: Strange hack. Ignores VRAM->VRAM transfers if the command word is not 80000000h.
    Bit 1: When set, makes the render polygon delay only apply if the polygon is textured.


  BIOS IOP Module Linking

IOP modules are dynamically linked to each other, but Sony devised an ingenious way to handle this without exposing symbols.
Linking is accomplished through export tables and import tables. A module can have multiple export tables, which define the functions other modules may access. Import tables give a module access to another module's export table.

The format of an export table is as follows.

  struct export_table
  {
    uint magic; //Must equal 0x41C00000!
    export_table* next; //Internal data for LOADCORE
    ushort version; //0x101 would be version 1.01
    ushort mode; //Unknown what this does
    char name[8]; //Name of the module. Must include a NULL terminator.
    void* export[0]; //An arbitrarily sized array of function pointers. 
  }

The format of a import table is similar.

  struct import_table
  {
    uint magic; //Must equal 0x41E00000!
    import_table* next; //Internal data for LOADCORE
    ushort version;
    ushort mode;
    char name[8];
    void* import[0]; //An arbitrarily sized array of jr ra; addiu zero, zero, X instruction pairs. More on that below.
  }

LOADCORE is responsible for linking modules to each other. When a new module is loaded, LOADCORE parses its import tables. When an import table matches an export table, it looks up functions by taking X from addiu zero, zero, X, which is used as an index in the export's function pointer array. Each jr ra is then replaced with j $function. In other words, the return statement is replaced with a direct jump to an imported module's function.

Since functions are only linked by their IDs, rather than their names, in theory this keeps others from learning the names of the functions. In practice, game developers often created custom IOP modules which they forgot to strip, which is how the symbols in Sony's IOP modules are known.

BIOS IOP MCSERV - Memory Card RPC Server
BIOS IOP PADMAN - Pad Input Manager


  BIOS IOP IOPBOOT - Kernel Bootstrap

IOPBOOT is technically not an IOP module, but rather, a raw binary file. It is responsible for parsing IOPBTCONF, loading SYSMEM and LOADCORE into memory, and passing execution to LOADCORE.

_entry(int ram_size, int boot_info, char *udnl_cmd, int unk)
The entry point is located at the start of IOPBOOT, BFC4A000h on SCPH-39001. ram_size is the total size of IOP RAM in megabytes. boot_info determines how IOPBOOT will find IOPBTCONF, more on that below. udnl_cmd is the full command string used to load UDNL and an IOPRP image. unk is passed but not used anywhere.

IOPBTCONF Format and Parsing
IOPBTCONF is the full list of modules that are loaded in the boot process, including SYSMEM and LOADCORE.
When IOPBOOT runs, it will first try to parse IOPBTCONx (where x is boot_info above), and if it can't find this, then it tries IOPBTCONF. On retail BIOSes, the only other file is IOPBTCON2, which is used to load modules after an IOP reboot. The regular IOPBTCONF is used for resets and the final phase of IOP reboot.

Each line in IOPBTCONF takes one of the following formats.

    @(START ADDR)
    The starting address of the kernel. IOPBOOT will place the first module at this address, and all other modules will be placed afterwards on 256-byte boundaries.
    !addr (FUNCTION ADDR)
    The function address here is executed while the modules are being loaded.
    !include (NAME)
    Acts like header file declarations, allowing another IOPBTCONF file to be parsed inside of the current one.
    NOTE: The parsing for this is buggy. Files can only be included at the start or end of the list, and only one file can ever be included.
    #(COMMENT)
    Lines starting with # are treated as comments and ignored.
    (MODULE NAME)
    An IOP module to be loaded during boot. 


Example IOPBTCONF
This excerpt was pulled from an SCPH-39001 BIOS.

  @800
  SYSMEM
  LOADCORE
  EXCEPMAN
  INTRMANP
  INTRMANI
  SSBUSC
  DMACMAN
  TIMEMANP
  TIMEMANI
  ...



  BIOS IOP SYSMEM - Memory Management

SYSMEM is the first module to be loaded. It partitions memory as a linked list of 31 blocks, each block being an arbitrarily-sized multiple of 256 bytes.
When too many blocks are allocated, SYSMEM will expand its block list by an additional 31 blocks; it can also free block lists that are no longer in use.

Exports
00h void* _start(int mem_size)
Initializes the memory allocator using the amount of memory given in bytes. Returns a pointer to alloced memory if successful, NULL otherwise.

04h void* AllocSysMemory(int mode, int size, void* ptr)
Allocates memory, returning a pointer to the memory if successful, NULL otherwise. size is rounded up to the nearest 256-byte boundary.
If mode==0, SYSMEM will allocate the first block in the list that meets the requirements.
If mode==1, SYSMEM will instead allocate the last free block.
If mode==2, SYSMEM will attempt to allocate memory at the given address in ptr. ptr is not used in any other mode.

05h int FreeSysMemory(void* ptr)
Frees memory, returning 0 if successful.

06h uint QueryMemSize()
Returns the total size of RAM in bytes.

07h uint QueryMaxFreeMemSize()
Returns the size of the largest free block in bytes - due to memory fragmentation, this is not necessarily the size of all free memory.

08h uint QueryTotalFreeMemSize()
Returns the amount of free memory in bytes.

09h void* QueryBlockTopAddress(void* addr)
Returns the starting address of the block that the given address is in. If a block is found but free, bit 31 of the result is set. Returns NULL if no block is found.
For example, if 0x150 is an allocated address, this function will return 0x100, as blocks must be allocated on a 256-byte boundary.

0Ah int QueryBlockSize(void* addr)
Returns the size of the block that the given address is in. If a block is found but free, bit 31 of the result is set. Returns NULL if no block is found.

0Eh int Kprintf(const char* format,...)
Wrapper function for the handler passed by KprintfSet. Does nothing if no handler is set.

0Fh void KprintfSet(KprintfHandler* handler, void* context)
Provides a handler function for Kprintf.


  BIOS IOP LOADCORE - Kernel Loader and Linker

LOADCORE is the second module to be loaded. It loads and executes all necessary boot modules while also linking module imports to registered export tables.

Exports
00h void ((noreturn)) _start(lc_params* param)

  struct lc_params
  {
    uint ram_size;
    int boot_mode; //Determines what kind of reset has occurred, used by MODLOAD to start UDNL when rebooting the IOP.
    char* udnl_str; //Full argument list passed to UDNL
    u32* sysmem_start;
    void* img_pos; //Pointer to memory that should be allocated. Used by UDNL to contain the updated modules.
    int img_buff_size;
    int module_count;
    u32** module_addr_list; //List of all modules to load. This includes SYSMEM and LOADCORE
  }

Boots all given modules, executes any post-boot callbacks, then enters an infinite loop.

04h void FlushIcache()
Flushes the icache. This should be used when executing code that is freshly loaded in memory, though the kernel handles this when new modules are loaded.

05h void FlushDcache()
Flushes the dcache. This should be used when passing data to and from peripherals, such as DMA.

06h int RegisterLibraryEntries(export_table* t)
Registers an export table, returning 0 if successful.
If an export table under the given name is already registered, several things can happen:
- If the major versions differ, the new export table is also registered, being treated as separate.
- If the new table's minor version is higher, the old table is destroyed, and any imports connected to the old table are updated to the new table.
- If the new table's minor version is lower or the same, the function fails.

07h int ReleaseLibraryEntries(export_table* t)
Unregisters an export table, returning 0 if successful.

0Ah int RegisterNonAutoLinkEntries(export_table* t)
Registers an export table that imports cannot link to, returning 0 if successful.

0Bh export_table* QueryLibraryEntryTable(iop_library* library)
Returns the export table associated with a registered library.

0Ch int* QueryBootMode(int mode)
Returns a registered "boot mode".

0Dh void RegisterBootMode(int* b)
Registers a boot mode, intended to give information to modules that LOADCORE executes.
Boot mode 4, for example, is used by MODLOAD to determine if UDNL should execute.

14h int RegisterPostBootCallback(BootupCallback func, int priority, int *stat)
Registers a function to be called after LOADCORE has finished loading all modules.


  BIOS IOP EXCEPMAN - Exception Manager

EXCEPMAN installs exception vectors at RAM addresses 0x40 and 0x80, but they do not do anything useful by themselves. Other modules will use EXCEPMAN to install their own handlers.

07h int ReleaseExceptionHandler(int exception, ExceptionHandler handler)

08h int ReleaseDefaultExceptionHandler(ExceptionHandler handler)


  BIOS IOP INTRMAN - Interrupt Manager

INTRMAN installs the default interrupt and syscall vectors, though like EXCEPMAN, it is up to other modules to install useful handlers.
Note: the actual module name is INTRMANI - "intrman" is the export table name.
There is also an INTRMANP variant, possibly for PSX compatibility?

Not sure what this does. It seems to clear out NVRAM for configuration settings and initialize some things after a reboot? Needs more research. No exports.


  BIOS IOP THREADMAN - Thread Manager

This is a relatively large module that handles everything related to threading and scheduling.
The scheduler algorithm is currently unknown, though it is likely similar to the EE kernel's scheduler - that is to say, cooperatively threaded. The IOP kernel has more functionality though, such as event flags and message boxes.
THREADMAN contains multiple export tables. To make things more organized, they are split here into separate sections.

  BIOS IOP REBOOT - SIF Reboot Server

REBOOT installs a custom SIF command handler for 80000003h and waits for this command to be sent.

IOP Reboot Procedure

    The EE sends SIF command 80000003h with an argument of "rom0:UDNL [last image file]..[first image file] [-v]". An example image path is "cdrom0:\MODULES\IOPRP243.IMG;1" (sent by Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana). The -v flag is recognized by UDNL but doesn't seem to have any effect.
    REBOOT calls MODLOAD.ReBootStart. MODLOAD cleans up all module libaries and jumps to IOPBOOT.
    IOPBOOT bootstraps SYSMEM and LOADCORE. LOADCORE loads all modules in IOPBTCON2.
    When MODLOAD is reloaded, it installs a post-boot callback in LOADCORE. This callback jumps to the UDNL module.
    UDNL scans all provided image files and finds the newest modules in each of them, then triggers yet another reset by bootstrapping SYSMEM and LOADCORE.
    LOADCORE reads from IOPBTCONF and loads the newest modules in the image files or the ones in the boot ROM. The reboot is now complete.

Image File Format
Like the BIOS, an image file contains a ROMDIR filesystem. An image file usually contains a RESET file of zero bytes, ROMDIR, EXTINFO, and a list of newer IOP modules to load.


  BIOS IOP LOADFILE - Module Loader RPC Server

The first real SIF RPC server that is loaded. Mainly responsible for loading new IOP modules and EE ELFs.
